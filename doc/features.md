# Optional Features

Some of these features require CGI scripts to execute on your server. In order for them
to function, make sure your server is configured to allow the execution of
CGI files. Next, enable these features in your configuration file.

## Layer Preview Images

By default during the build process we try to fetch images of layers from our Snapshots application to show as previews in the layer picker component.  However, this will only work for layers that are present in NASA GIBS (Global Imagery Browse Service).  If you are serving your own layers, you will likely wish to disable this feature by setting `"previewSnapshots": false` in `config/default/common/features.json`.

## Natural Events

This feature provides natural events queried by Earth Observatory Natural Event Tracker (EONET) by default. To enable, edit `config/default/common/features.json` and set:

```
"naturalEvents": {
    "host": "[host_url_here]"
}
```

to disable, set:
`"naturalEvents": false`

## Data Download

This feature uses CGI scripts to query the CMR API on the server. To enable,
edit `config/default/common/features.json` and set `"dataDownload": true`.

## URL Shortening

This feature uses
[bit.ly](http://bit.ly) to shorten links. Follow these steps to enable it:

* Edit `config/default/common/features.json` and set `"urlShortening": true`.
* Get a login and API key from [bit.ly](http://bit.ly).
* Create `build/options/bitly.json` with the following contents (replacing `your_login` and `your_key` with the appropriate values);

```json
{
  "login": "your_login",
  "key": "your_key"
}
```

> Caution: Do not commit this file to a public repo, and make sure the `build/options` directory is not publicly accessible on your web server to protect the privacy of your API key.
