# Testing

Run the entire test suite using `npm test`.

## Linting

To check code against the project's style guides, use `npm run lint`.
Use `npm run lint:css` or `npm run lint:js` to check CSS or JS files separately.

## Unit Tests

Unit tests are run using the Jest testing framework. Unit tests ran as part of the main testing suite, i.e. `npm test`.
Use `npm test:unit` to run unit tests individually.
_Note:_ Make sure to run `npm run getcapabilities` and
`npm run build:config` first to build the configuration.

To test against a different time zone, run `npm run test:unit:tz`. _Note:_ This currently doesn't work in Windows.

To view the unit test code coverage, run `npm run test:coverage`.
Use `npm run test:unit:coverage` or `npm run test:unit:tz:coverage` to run coverage tests individually.

## End-to-end Tests

End to end tests are integrated into our CI and are required to pass before a submission is accepted. New features should be accompanied by End to End tests to cover any new functionality you add.

Run end-to-end tests using `npm run e2e`

To run the end-to-end tests using Firefox in a docker container, create an image using `npm run docker:image`. Run the tests with `npm run docker:e2e`. See the [Docker](docker.md) page for more information.

### Browserstack

Run `npm run browserstack`  to test the app in `Chrome(OS X and Windows)`, `Firefox(Windows)`, `Internet Exporer(windows)`, and `Safari(OS X)` on BrowserStack. The tests run the `nightwatch.js` features found in `./e2e/features` using Selenium.

To run tests in BrowserStack from your local machine:

1) Log into [BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com/automate) and get your username and access key from the upper left.
2) Add the following to your shell configuration (`.bashrc` or `.profile`);

```bash
export BROWSERSTACK_ACCESS_KEY=yourkeyhere
export BROWSERSTACK_USER=yourusernamehere
```

### Selenium Drivers

 **(Note)** Driver reliability varies between Operating systems. Using local selenium drivers to run tests is more useful as a development tool for creating new tests than it is for verifying if all tests are passing.

To run tests on your machine using a Chrome driver: Run `npm run e2e:chrome`.

To run tests on your machine using a Firefox driver:

1) [Create a new Firefox profile](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox/Multiple_profiles) called 'nightwatch'.
2) Run `npm run e2e:firefox`.

To run tests for both browsers in sequence: `npm run e2e`.

### Developing new End to End Tests

* When creating new tests you will likely want to work locally with a `chrome` or `Firefox` driver to expedite the development process.

* If there is a specific test that you would like to run, you can change the `files` variable found in `./e2e/browserstack.conf.js` to point directly to your test.
* If there is a specific browser that you would like to test, you can specify which in `./e2e/environments.json`
