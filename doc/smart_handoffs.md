# Data Download (Smart Handoff's)

Data Download (Smart Handoff's) allows directing users to [Earth data Search](https://search.earthdata.nasa.gov/) to download the underlying data for layers.

**Note**: This feature relies on the [Common Metadata Repository (CMR)](https://cmr.earthdata.nasa.gov/) and does not work for data sets stored elsewhere. This feature also relies on visualization metadata served by [GIBS](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/gibs) in order to map a layer in Worldview to the corresponding data collections in CMR.
