## Development

*Please Note*: There is litte to no documentation at ths time and any
comments in the code may be out of date.

### Minification of CSS and JavaScript files

The build script needs to know which files to minify and the correct order used
to concatenate. Anytime a CSS or JavaScript file is added. renamed, or removed,
the following files must be updated:

* ``etc/deploy/wv.css.json``
* ``etc/deploy/wv.js.json``

To ensure that references to the unminified value are removed in the production
version, prefix all CSS or JavaScript link tags with

    <!-- link.dev -->

If there are some CSS or JavaScript files that must be available in
non-concatenated form, add exceptions in the ``remove:source`` task in
``Gruntfile.js``

## Naming and Versioning

The ``options.json`` file contains the name, version, and release number
that is used when building the deployment packages. The name can be changed
to allow side-by-side deployments of different branches. Executing:

     grunt

also creates distribution tarballs in the dist directory. Three "unversioned"
files are generated:

* ``dist/worldview.tar.bz2``
* ``dist/worldview-debug.tar.bz2``
* ``dist/worldview-doc.tar.bz2``

Three "versioned" files are also generated in the form of:

* ``dist/<name>-<version>-<release>.git<revision>.tar.bz2``

Where ``name``, ``version``, ``release`` are the values found in the
``package.json`` file and ``revision`` is the value from:

    git rev-parse --short HEAD

The ``options.json`` file in the repository root is copied from the
active brand directory. To make changes, edit the official copy in the
brand directory.


## Grunt Targets

These additional grunt targets are available.

### Branding

Any changes to the brading directories need to be applied to the source
tree to take effect:

    grunt brand


### Configuration

The Worldivew configuration file is generated by concatenating all files
in ``conf/web``

To regenerate the master configuration file in the source tree after making
an edit, issue the following command:

    grunt config


### Linting

Check for common errors in the JavaScript and CSS files with:

    grunt lint


### Documentation

Documentation can be built separately with:

    grunt doc

### Unit Tests

Run unit test with the following:

    grunt test

This uses BusterJS with PhantomJS for headless browser testing. To test in an
actual browser which is quicker, install the Buster command line tools
with:

    sudo npm install --global buster-cli

For static testing like QUnit, run the following and navigate the web browser
to the address shown:

    buster-static

For browser capturing, run the following and navigate the web browser to
the address shown:

    buster-server


### RPM

To create an RPM on CentOS 6, issue the following:

    grunt rpm-only

Built RPMs will be found in the ``dist`` directory.
