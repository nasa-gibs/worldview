Interactive interface for browsing full-resolution, global satellite imagery.

## Background

This app from NASA's [EOSDIS](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/) provides the
capability to interactively browse over 900 global, full-resolution satellite
imagery layers on desktop and mobile devices. Many of the imagery layers are
updated daily and are within three hours of observation - showing the entire Earth as it is
"right now". This supports time-critical applications such as wildfire
management, air quality measurements, and flood monitoring. Some satellite
imagery layers span almost 30 years, providing a long term view of our dynamic
planet. The underlying data is available for download, and Arctic and Antarctic
views of several imagery layers are available for a “full globe” perspective.

Worldview uses [OpenLayers](http://openlayers.org/) to display imagery from the
[Global Imagery Browse Services (GIBS)](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/gibs). This
imagery can also be used [with libraries such as Leaflet, Cesium, Google Maps](https://wiki.earthdata.nasa.gov/display/GIBS/Map+Library+Usage)
or [custom GDAL scripts](https://wiki.earthdata.nasa.gov/display/GIBS/Map+Library+Usage#expand-GDALBasics).
We encourage interested developers to fork Worldview or build their own clients
using GIBS services.
