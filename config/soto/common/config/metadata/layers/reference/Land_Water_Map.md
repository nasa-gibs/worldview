The Land/Water Map base layer is a representation of land in dark grey and water in light grey.  It was created to provide a neutral-colored base layer for context underneath the oftentimes more colorful overlays.

The Land/Water Map was gleaned from [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright).
