The Latitude-Longitude Lines layers is a vector layer displaying the grid/graticule of latitude and longitude lines over the globe.

In the geographic projection, Latitude-Longitude Lines are generated from the graticule capability within [OpenLayers](https://openlayers.org/). For the Arctic and Antarctic polar stereographic projections, the graticule layers are generated from [Polarview](https://www.polarview.aq/).
