The Air Mass layer from the GOES-West Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) is used primarily for distinguishing between polar and tropical air masses, especially along frontal boundaries and identify high, mid, and low-level clouds. It can also be used to infer cyclogenesis by identifying warm, dry, ozone-rich descending stratospheric air associated with jet streams and potential vorticity (PV) anomalies. The RGB image is comprised of Bands 6.2-7.3, 9.6-10.4 and 6.2.

The Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES)-West satellite (currently, GOES-17) is centered on 137.2 degrees W, covering most of the Pacific Ocean, the USA, most of Canada, Central, the western half of South America, parts of Australasia. The GOES-West ABI imagery is available on a rolling monthly basis at 10 minute intervals. The sensor resolution is 2 km, the imagery resolution in Worldview/Global Imaging Browse Services (GIBS) is 2 km and the temporal resolution is 10 minutes.
