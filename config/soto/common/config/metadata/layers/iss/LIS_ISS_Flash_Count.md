The ISS LIS Flash Count layer provides the number of lightning flashes recorded by the Lightning Imaging Sensor (LIS) on board the International Space Station (ISS).The ISS LIS provides total lightning measurements between +/- 48 degrees latitude which covers a geographic range that includes nearly all global lightning. ISS LIS monitors total global lightning in both day and night and provides important cross-sensor calibration and validation with the Geostationary Lightning Mapper (GLM) and ground-based lightning networks.

ISS LIS supplies near real-time lightning data over data-sparse regions, such as oceans, to support operational weather forecasting and warning. ISS LIS standard science products are available at GHRC DAAC.

The Lightning Imaging Sensor (LIS) was placed on the International Space Station in Feb 2017. LIS is mounted to the station as part of the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) Space Test Program (STP)-H5 science and technology development payload. By placing LIS on the space station, which has a highly inclined orbit, a greater geographic range of measurements are obtained than previously measured by TRMM LIS.
