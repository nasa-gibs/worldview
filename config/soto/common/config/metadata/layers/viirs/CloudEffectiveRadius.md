### Cloud Effective Radius
Temporal coverage: 1 March 2012 - Present

The VIIRS Cloud Effective Radius layer is a measure of cloud particle size in microns (Î¼m). It is retrieved globally during day time for liquid and ice phases. Generally, smaller the particle size, brighter and more reflective are the clouds. The smaller cloud particles tend to reflect and scatter more sunlight back into space.

The VIIRS Cloud Effective Radius layer is available from the joint NASA/NOAA Suomi NPP satellite for daytime overpasses. The sensor/algorithm resolution is 750 m, imagery resolution is 1 km, and the temporal resolution is daily.
