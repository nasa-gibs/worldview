### AIRS Prata Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) Index (Day | Night)
Temporal coverage:  8 May 2012 - present

The AIRS Prata SO2 Index Day/Night layer indicates Sulfur Dioxide column amounts in the atmosphere, measured in Dobson Units (DU).

Sulfur Dioxide (SO2), is a colorless gas with a pungent, suffocating odor that is water soluble to produce the acid, H2SO3. SO2 is one of the US Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) six major regulated criteria pollutants (Tropospheric Ozone, Nitrogen dioxide, Sulfur dioxide, Lead, PM2.5 and PM10 particulates). It irritates the eyes, nose, and lungs. High concentrations of SO2 can result in temporary breathing impairment. It is produced by combustion of coal, fuel oil, and gasoline, since these fuels contain sulfur in the combustion, and in the oxidation of naturally occurring sulfur gases. It is a precursor to sulfuric acid, which is a major constituent of acid rain. SO2 is injected into the stratosphere by volcanic eruptions. SO2 also is a major precursor to PM2.5 (Particulate Matter up to 2.5 micrometers in size), which is a significant health concern, and a main contributor to poor visibility. These data are used by the Volcanic Ash Advisory Centers in advisories to airlines for operational decisions.

The AIRS Sulfur Dioxide Index Prata algorithm was authored by Fred Prata from the Norwegian Institute for Air Research.

The Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) is an instrument on board the Aqua satellite. The AIRS Prata SO2 Index science parameter is a derived parameter from the Level 1B Near-Real Time Infrared (IR) geolocated and calibrated radiances, (AIRIBRAD_NRT). The imagery resolution is 2 km and sensor resolution is 45 km. The temporal resolution is daily.

### Sulfur Dioxide Brightness Temperature Difference (L2, Day | Night)
Temporal coverage: 30 August 2002 - Present

#### Description
Sulfur dioxide (SO2) brightness temperature difference is calculated by subtracting brightness temperature values reported in two AIRS channels, one that is sensitive to SO2 and one that is not. A large difference implies greater SO2 absorption. Note that clouds can block the detection of the SO2 signal by the AIRS instrument. Sulfur dioxide can also be emitted from volcanic eruptions. Volcanic SO2 absorbs the energy in passing infrared wavelengths of light, or radiances, in transit from the surface of the Earth to space. This absorption is controlled by the types and quantities of the components within the plume, together with other factors such as cloud cover, surface temperature and emissivity.

#### About AIRS
AIRS, in conjunction with the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU), senses emitted infrared and microwave radiation from Earth to provide a three-dimensional look at Earth's weather and climate. Working in tandem, the two instruments make simultaneous observations down to Earth's surface. With more than 2,000 channels sensing different regions of the atmosphere, the system creates a global, three-dimensional map of atmospheric temperature and humidity, cloud amounts and heights, greenhouse gas concentrations and many other atmospheric phenomena. Launched into Earth orbit in 2002, the AIRS and AMSU instruments fly onboard NASA's Aqua spacecraft and are managed by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.
