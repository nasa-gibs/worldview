### MLS Temperature 46hPa (Day | Night)
Temporal coverage: 9 May 2013 - present

The Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) Temperature layer indicates the temperature of the atmosphere at the vertical atmospheric pressure level of 46 hectopascals (hPa) and is measured in Kelvin (K). The MLS instrument measures naturally-occurring microwave thermal emission from the limb (edge) of the Earth's atmosphere to remotely sense vertical profiles of atmospheric gases, temperature, pressure, and cloud ice.

The MLS Temperature 46hPa layer is derived from the MLS Temperature product (ML2T_NRT) available from the Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) instrument on the Aura satellite. The sensor resolution is 5 km, imagery resolution is 2 km, and the temporal resolution is daily.
