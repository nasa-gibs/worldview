The OMPS Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) Upper Troposphere and Stratosphere layer indicates the column density of sulfur dioxide in the upper troposphere and stratosphere (corresponding to 17 km center of mass altitude (CMA)) and is measured in Dobson Units (DU). This layer can be used for studies on explosive volcanic eruptions.

The OMPS Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) Upper Troposphere and Stratosphere layer is a science parameter of the Ozone Mapping and Profiler Suite (OMPS)-NPP L2 NM Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) Total and Tropospheric Column swath orbital collection 2 version 2.0 product. It is available from the OMPS Nadir-Mapper (NM) sensor on the joint NASA/NOAA Suomi National Polar orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP) satellite. The sensor resolution is 25 km, imagery resolution is 2 km, and the temporal resolution is daily.
