Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) is one of the US Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) six major regulated criteria pollutants (Tropospheric Ozone, Nitrogen Dioxide, Sulfur Dioxide, Lead, PM2.5 and PM 10 particulates). It irritates the eyes, nose, and lungs. High concentrations of SO2 can result in temporary breathing impairment. It is produced by combustion of coal, fuel oil, and gasoline, since these fuels contain sulfur in the combustion, and in the oxidation of naturally occurring sulfur gases. It is a precursor to sulfuric acid, which is a major constituent of acid rain. SO2 is injected into the stratosphere by volcanic eruptions. SO2 also is a major precursor to PM2.5, which is a significant health concern, and a main contributor to poor visibility.

### Sulfur Dioxide (Planetary Boundary Layer)
Temporal coverage: 26 January 2012 - present

The OMPS Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) Planetary Boundary Layer (PBL) indicates the column density of sulfur dioxide in the tropospheric boundary-layer (corresponding to the center of mass altitude (CMA) of 0.9 km) and is measured in Dobson Units (DU). The planetary boundary layer is often used in studies on near-surface pollution.

The OMPS Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) Planetary Boundary Layer is a science parameter of the Ozone Mapping and Profiler Suite (OMPS)-NPP L2 NM Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) Total and Tropospheric Column swath orbital collection 2 version 2.0 product. It is available from the OMPS Nadir-Mapper (NM) sensor on the joint NASA/NOAA Suomi National Polar orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP) satellite. The sensor resolution is 25 km, imagery resolution is 2 km, and the temporal resolution is daily.

### Sulfur Dioxide (Lower Troposphere)
Temporal coverage: 26 January 2012 - present

The OMPS Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) Lower Troposphere layer indicates the column density of sulfur dioxide in the lower troposphere (corresponding to 2.5 km center of mass altitude (CMA)) and is measured in Dobson Units (DU). The lower troposphere layer can be used to study degassing from volcanic sources.

The OMPS Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) Lower Troposphere layer is a science parameter of the Ozone Mapping and Profiler Suite (OMPS)-NPP L2 NM Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) Total and Tropospheric Column swath orbital collection 2 version 2.0 product. It is available from the OMPS Nadir-Mapper (NM) sensor on the joint NASA/NOAA Suomi National Polar orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP) satellite. The sensor resolution is 25 km, imagery resolution is 2 km, and the temporal resolution is daily.

### Sulfur Dioxide (Middle Troposphere)
Temporal coverage: 26 January 2012 - present

The OMPS Sulfur Dioxide (Middle Troposphere) layer indicates the column density of sulfur dioxide in the middle troposphere (corresponding to 7.5 km center of mass altitude (CMA)) and is measured in Dobson Units (DU). This layer can be used in studies on moderate eruptions and long-range transport of sulfur pollution.

The OMPS Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) Middle Troposphere layer is a science parameter of the Ozone Mapping and Profiler Suite (OMPS)-NPP L2 NM Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) Total and Tropospheric Column swath orbital collection 2 version 2.0 product. It is available from the OMPS Nadir-Mapper (NM) sensor on the joint NASA/NOAA Suomi National Polar orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP) satellite. The sensor resolution is 25 km, imagery resolution is 2 km, and the temporal resolution is daily.

### Sulfur Dioxide (Upper Troposphere and Stratosphere)
Temporal coverage: 26 January 2012 - present

The OMPS Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) Upper Troposphere and Stratosphere layer indicates the column density of sulfur dioxide in the upper troposphere and stratosphere (corresponding to 17 km center of mass altitude (CMA)) and is measured in Dobson Units (DU). This layer can be used for studies on explosive volcanic eruptions.

The OMPS Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) Upper Troposphere and Stratosphere layer is a science parameter of the Ozone Mapping and Profiler Suite (OMPS)-NPP L2 NM Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) Total and Tropospheric Column swath orbital collection 2 version 2.0 product. It is available from the OMPS Nadir-Mapper (NM) sensor on the joint NASA/NOAA Suomi National Polar orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP) satellite. The sensor resolution is 25 km, imagery resolution is 2 km, and the temporal resolution is daily.
