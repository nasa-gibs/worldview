The MAIAC Isotropic Kernel Parameters (RTLS Model, 8-Day) layer is an RGB image of Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) isotropic kernel parameter of the Ross-Thick Li-Sparse (RTLS) BRDF model over land based on MODIS bands 1, 4, 3. The bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) characterizes anisotropy of reflectance by natural land surfaces. It is widely used in the modeling and remote sensing. In collection 6, the MAIAC BRDF model is reported every 8 days for MODIS bands 1-8 at 1km resolution on global Sinusoidal projection (MCD19A3). The product is naturally gap-filled: the previous solution stays in active MAIAC memory for every 1km grid cell until updated with latest RTLS from cloud-free observations. The update day is reported in MCD19A1. When surface is covered by snow, the RTLS represents the latest retrieval prior to snowfall. The knowledge of spectral BRDF of the snow-free land surface allows MAIAC to accurately derive the sub-pixel snow fraction and snow grain size using spectral unmixing approach.

The MAIAC Combined Isotropic Kernel Parameters layer is available as a combined Terra satellite and Aqua satellite layer (MCD19A3). The sensor resolution is 1 km, imagery resolution is 1 km, and the temporal resolution is 8-day.
