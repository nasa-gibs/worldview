### MAIAC Columnar Water Vapor
Temporal coverage: 28 September 2019 - present

The MAIAC Columnar Water Vapor (CWV) shows the total amount of water vapor in the column of atmosphere. It is measured in centimeters (cm) showing the depth of liquid water if all vapor were condensed. MAIAC provides CWV over land, over ocean regions with sunglint, and over clouds. In the latter case, CWV is the amount of water vapor above clouds. Validation over land shows the accuracy of 10-15%.

Water cycles through the Earth’s atmosphere in three states: solid (ice), liquid (rain drops), gas (water vapor). Water vapor is the gaseous form of water, the result of evaporation. Water vapor is a strong greenhouse gas: it traps the heat from the Earth surface and keeps the Earth warm. When water vapor rises into the atmosphere, it cools and turns back into water droplets. Water droplets form clouds and eventually some clouds produce rain or snow. Monitoring water vapor is useful as it influences weather patterns and is an important component of the Earth’s climate system.

The MAIAC Columnar Water Vapor product combines data from Terra and Aqua satellites. The sensor resolution is 1 km, imagery resolution is 1 km, and the temporal resolution is daily.
