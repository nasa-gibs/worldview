The Surface Reflectance (Bands 1-5-7, Global, Annual, V3.1) layer is a color composite of images from all available Landsat 4 and 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) and Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) Collection 1 data and is produced by the Global Web Enabled Landsat Data (GWELD) project. The layer is created from Landsat Band 1, 5, 7 surface reflectance. This combination provides a false color image focusing on snow and ice.

#### Snow and Ice
Snow and ice appear bright red. Thick ice and snow appear vivid red (or red-orange), while small ice crystals in high-level clouds will appear reddish-orange or peach.

#### Vegetation
Vegetation will appear greenish in this band combination. Bare soil will appear bright cyan.

#### Water
Liquid water on the ground will be very dark, but small liquid water drops in clouds will appear white. Sediments in water appear dark red.

The sensor resolution is 30 m with an imagery resolution is 31.25 m. The temporal availability is annual for 1989 - 2001.
