The Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP)/Sentinel-1 "Soil Moisture (L2, Active-Passive, Radiometer and Radar)" layer displays surface soil moisture in cm<sup>3</sup>/cm<sup>3</sup> posted on a 3 km EASE-Grid 2.0. L-band brightness temperatures from the SMAP radiometer during 6:00 a.m. descending half-orbit passes and C-band backscatter coefficients from the Copernicus Sentinel-1A and -1B radar are used to derive soil moisture data.

This data set contains modified Copernicus Sentinel-1 data (2015-present), acquired by the European Space Agency (ESA), distributed through the Alaska Satellite Facility (ASF), and processed by the SMAP Science Data System.
