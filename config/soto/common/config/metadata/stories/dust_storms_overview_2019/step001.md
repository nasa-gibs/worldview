Sand and dust storms commonly occur in arid and semi-arid regions, like deserts. Strong winds pick up dust and sand from areas with dry, bare soils, lift the dust into the atmosphere, and can transport the dust many, many kilometers away. Main sources of dust are Northern Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, Central Asia and China. Areas like Australia, America and South Africa have minor contributions, yet are still important. Providing a general idea of where the major dust contributors are, this Dust Surface Mass Concentration layer from the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2) shows the dust surface mass concentrations for February 2019. MERRA-2 assimilates space-based observations and model-bases analyses to produce long-term, global information on the Earth System.
