The MISR Radiance Average layer displays the temporal average of all radiances measured by MISR’s cameras in the red, green, and blue bands over a particular month. Radiance is a measure of the energy emitted and/or reflected by the Earth’s surface in a particular direction, per unit area, per wavelength. MISR’s radiances are reported in units of W m<sup>-2</sup> sr<sup>-1</sup> µm<sup>-1</sup>. MISR radiances are used to create natural-color images. Along with the measurements from MISR’s near-infrared band, these radiances are the base measurements from which all other MISR data products are produced.

This layer is produced from the Average field of the MISR Level 3 Component Global Georectified Radiance Product. It is available globally over both land and ocean on a monthly basis, with a spatial resolution of 0.5 degrees latitude by 0.5 degrees longitude.
