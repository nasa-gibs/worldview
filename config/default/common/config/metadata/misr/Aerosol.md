### Aerosol Optical Depth Average (Green, Monthly)
Temporal Coverage: March 2000 - present (Monthly)

The MISR Aerosol Optical Depth Average layer displays the temporal averages of all aerosol optical depths calculated from radiances acquired from the green band (555 nm) of MISR’s cameras over a particular month. Aerosol optical depth (AOD) is a unitless measure of how much of the Sun’s incoming light is blocked by small particles – called aerosols – in the atmosphere. Low aerosol optical depths correspond to clear skies, while higher AODs are measured when smoke, dust, or other air pollutants partially block sunlight. MISR aerosol optical depths are calculated based on radiances measured by the instruments’ nine cameras. Aerosol optical depths are important for tracking air pollution for public health purposes, tracking the transport of smoke, dust and volcanic ash, and studying the impact of aerosols on the climate.

This layer is produced from the Optical depth average field of the MISR Level 3 Component Global Aerosol Product. It is available globally over both land and ocean on a monthly basis, with a spatial resolution of 0.5 degrees latitude by 0.5 degrees longitude. Coverage may be limited in areas with frequent cloudiness.
