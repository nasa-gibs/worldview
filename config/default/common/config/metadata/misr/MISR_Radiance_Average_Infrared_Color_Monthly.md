The MISR Radiance Average layer displays the temporal average of all radiances measured by MISR’s cameras in the near-infrared band (865 nm) over a particular month. Radiance is a measure of the energy emitted and/or reflected by the Earth’s surface in a particular direction, per unit area, per wavelength. MISR’s radiances are reported in units of W m<sup>-2</sup> sr<sup>-1</sup> µm<sup>-1</sup>. MISR near-infrared radiances are used to create false-color images (alone or with some combination of the red, blue, and green bands), and are useful for monitoring the health of vegetation, which appears bright in this wavelength. Along with the measurements from MISR’s red, blue, and green bands, these radiances are the base measurements from which all other MISR data products are produced.

This layer is produced from the Average field of the MISR Level 3 Component Global Georectified Radiance Product. It is available globally over both land and ocean on a monthly basis, with a spatial resolution of 0.5 degrees latitude by 0.5 degrees longitude.
