The Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) "Uncorrected Brightness Temperature 9 km RFI” layer displays Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) quality flags of uncorrected brightness temperatures (TBs) posted to a 9 km EASE-Grid 2.0 for the horizontal (H) polarization of the aft scan from the SMAP radiometer. RFI refers to the interference in measurements from other transmitters operating at frequencies adjacent to the SMAP L-band frequency.

Within the image, green indicates that TB observations are free of RFI and approved for science use, yellow indicates that caution should be used with the TB observations as RFI was detected but mitigated, and red indicates that TB observations are flagged as bad due to RFI.
