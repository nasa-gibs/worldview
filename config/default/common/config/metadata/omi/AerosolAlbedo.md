### Aerosol Single Scattering Albedo (Near-UV, 388.0 nm)
Temporal Coverage: 1 October 2004 - Present

The OMI Aerosol Single Scattering Albedo is one of the parameters contained in the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) Level-3 UV/VIS Aerosol product (OMAERUVd) product. The parameter is related to the absorbing properties; different values indicate that the aerosols originate from different sources. It measures the ratio of aerosol scattering efficiency to total aerosol attenuance indicating the amount and composition of aerosol loading in the atmosphere and a value near 1 implies that all particle extinction is due to scattering; conversely, a single-scattering albedo of 0 implies that all extinction is due to absorption. The OMI Aerosol Single Scattering Albedo is retrieved using a near-UV two-channel algorithm based on the spectral radiance measurements between 342.5 and 483.5 nm and is a unitless quantity.

The OMAERUVd product provides daily gridded global coverage with a temporal resolution of 1 day, imagery resolution of 2 km, and sensor/algorithm resolution of 1.0 x 1.0 degrees.
