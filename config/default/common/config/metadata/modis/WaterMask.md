The MODIS Global 250 m Water Map (MOD44W) is a static product. It was created using the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) Water Body Data (SWBD), 8 years of Terra MODIS and 6 years of Aqua MODIS 250 m data and the MODIS based Mosaic of Antarctica (MOA). The image resolution is 250 km. It can be downloaded from the [Land Processes (LP) DAAC - MOD44W: MODIS/Terra Land Water Mask Derived from MODIS and SRTM L3 Yearly Global 250 m SIN Grid V006](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/dataset_discovery/modis/modis_products_table/mod44w_v006).
