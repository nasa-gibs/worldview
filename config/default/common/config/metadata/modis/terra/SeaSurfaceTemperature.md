### Sea Surface Temperature (L3, Night, Daily | 8-Day | Monthly | Annual, Mid-IR, 4km)
Temporal coverage: 26 February 2000 - present

The MODIS L3 SST 4km layer shows global nighttime sea surface temperature (SST) at a depth of a few micrometers with ranges from -1.8 to 32 degree Celsius.  The SST is derived with a Mid-Infrared (Short–Wave) SST Algorithm that uses MODIS bands 22 and 23 at 3.959 and 4.050 μm. This Level 3 product is derived from native 1 km Level 2 SST observations that are mapped to a global 4.63 km grid. The temporal resolution of MODIS L3 SST is daily, 8-Day, monthly, and annually.

### Sea Surface Temperature (L3, Day, Daily | 8-Day | Monthly | Annual, Thermal, 4km)
Temporal coverage: 26 February 2000 - present

The MODIS L3 SST 4km layer shows global daytime sea surface temperature (SST) at a depth of a few micrometers with ranges from -1.8 to 32 degree Celsius. The SST is derived with a Thermal (Long–Wave) SST Algorithm that uses MODIS bands 31 and 32 at 11 and 12 μm.
