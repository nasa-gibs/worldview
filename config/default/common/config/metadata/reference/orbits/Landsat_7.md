### Landsat 7 Orbital Track & Overpass Time (Ascending/Night)
The Landsat 7 Orbital Track & Overpass Time (Ascending/Night) layer is the path of the Landsat 7 satellite on its ascending/night-time orbit. Overpass times are shown in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). Landsat 7 is on a sun-synchronous orbit at an altitude of 705 km (438 mi).

### Landsat 7 Orbital Track & Overpass Time (Descending/Day)
The Landsat 7 Orbital Track & Overpass Time (Descending/Day) layer is the path of the Landsat 7 satellite on its descending/day-time orbit. Overpass times are shown in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). Landsat 7 is on a sun-synchronous orbit from north to south at an altitude of 705 km (438 mi) with an equatorial crossing time of 10:00 a.m. +/- 15 minutes mean local time on each pass to provide maximum illumination with minimum water vapor (haze and cloud build-up).
