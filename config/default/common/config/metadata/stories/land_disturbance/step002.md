The DIST-ALERT layer maps per pixel vegetation disturbance, specifically vegetation cover loss, based on confidence, magnitude of loss, and whether it is ongoing. There are three confidence levels: "first detection" which is loss detected in only the most recent observation, "provisional" upon a second detection of vegetation loss, and "confirmed" once there are sufficient loss detections to reach high confidence of disturbance. These are reported for both disturbances with <50% vegetation cover loss and those with â‰¥50% loss, whether diffuse across an entire pixel or just a portion of it. Hover over the colors on the map and the legend in the layer list to view the classifications.
