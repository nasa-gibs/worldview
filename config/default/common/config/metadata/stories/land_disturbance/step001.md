The Land Surface Disturbance product (DIST) maps disturbance detected when there is a change to the land surface outside a historical norm. This product is based on the Harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2 (HLS) imagery and is available at 30 meter resolution on a near-global basis through the Observational Products for End-Users from Remote Sensing Analysis (OPERA) project. In the future, this layer will be complemented with a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) based product from Sentinel-1.
