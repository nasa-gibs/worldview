This shows a confirmed disturbance in yellow and red - where there have been sufficient loss detections to reach a high confidence of disturbance. These labels persist as long as the anomalies continue to be detected. Once a location no longer has low vegetation cover, confirmed alerts are labeled as "finished" and the others are reset to no disturbance. This status is iteratively updated with each subsequent granule.
