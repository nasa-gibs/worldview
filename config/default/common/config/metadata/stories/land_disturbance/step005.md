January 2, 2025 shows confirmed disturbances in yellow and red - where there have been sufficient loss detections to reach a high confidence of disturbance. These labels persist as long as the anomalies continue to be detected. Once a location no longer has vegetation cover loss greater than 10%, confirmed alerts are labeled as "finished" and the others are reset to no disturbance. This status is iteratively updated with each subsequent granule. Disturbance events last up to a year in the DIST-ALERT layer, which are turned off and displayed in the annual disturbance product (Not yet available but coming soon to Worldview!).
