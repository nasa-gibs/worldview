 To produce the Nadir Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF)-Adjusted Reflectance (NBAR) imagery, the data from the two instruments aboard the three satellites are processed through a set of algorithms to make the imagery consistent and comparable across the instruments. This includes atmospheric correction, cloud and cloud-shadow masking, spatial co-registration and common gridding, illumination and view angle normalization, and spectral bandpass adjustment. Turn on and off the Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2A & 2B Reflectance layers by clicking on the eye icon to see how seamless the imagery is.
