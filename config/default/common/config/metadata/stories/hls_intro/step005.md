The Sentinel satellites have a 5 day revisit period and the Landsat satellite has a 16 day revisit period. This equates to global coverage in 2 to 3 days. These satellites have a smililar overpass time as the Terra satellite (approximately 10:30am local time equatorial crossing), providing continuity to the Terra/MODIS surface reflectance layers.
