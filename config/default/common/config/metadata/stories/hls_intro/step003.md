The Landsat satellite has a 16 day revisit period, whilst the Sentinel satellites have a 5 day revisit - which means there will be global coverage in 2 to 3 days. These satellites have a smililar overpass time as the Terra satellite (approximately 10:30am local time equatorial crossing), thereby providing continuity to the MODIS surface reflectance layers. Worldview will initially provide access to the Sentinel layer, S30 and the Landsat layer, L30 will come shortly thereafter.
