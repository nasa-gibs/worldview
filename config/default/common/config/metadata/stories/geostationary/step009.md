The GeoColor layer provides an approximation to daytime True Color imagery. The combination of spectral bands yields an appearance similar to what the human eye would perceive for land surface, oceanic and atmospheric features, with atmospheric correction used to make the appearance of these features sharper. Thus it is used primarily for the intuitive interpretation of meteorological and surface-based features such as smoke, blowing dust, and vegetation types (forests, deserts, croplands, etc.) This imagery is at 1 km resolution. This imagery is available on a rolling 90 day basis from the GOES-East and GOES-West satellites. Press "Play" to view a GOES-West animation showing smoke emanating from the Dixie Fire and Antelope Fires, and watch the formation of pyrocumulonimbus clouds creating fire driven thunderstorms in Northern California and Oregon on 5 August 2021, 18:40-22:30 UTC/11:40-15:40pm PDT.
