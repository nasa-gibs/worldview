Earth Observation satellites have three primary types of orbits: polar; non-polar, low-earth orbit; and geostationary. Worldview has routinely provided daily imagery from polar orbiting satellites like the joint NASA/NOAA Suomi NPP satellite, and some imagery from non-polar, low-earth orbit satellites like the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission.
