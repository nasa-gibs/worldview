Earth Observation satellites have three primary types of orbits: polar; non-polar, low-earth orbit and geostationary. Worldview has routinely provided imagery from polar orbiting satellites like the Terra satellite, and some imagery from non-polar, low-earth orbit satellites like the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission. Worldview now also has imagery from several geostationary satellites, which follow the Earth's rotation and travel at the same rate of the rotation, so from Earth, it appears the satellite is fixed in one location. This means the satellite captures the same view of Earth and provides almost continuous coverage of one area. Worldview has imagery from the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES)-East (curreltny GOES-R/GOES-16) and GOES-West (currently, GOES-S/GOES-17), and Himawari-8.
