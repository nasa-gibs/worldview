Worldview now has imagery from several geostationary satellites! These satellites follow the same direction and rate of the Earth's rotation, so from Earth, it appears the satellite is fixed in one location. This means the satellite captures the same view of Earth and provides almost continuous coverage of one area. Worldview has imagery from the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites-East (GOES-East), GOES-West, and Himawari-8. The geostationary imagery is available in 10 minute increments, available approximately 30 to 40 minutes after satellite observation, and on a rolling 30 to 90 day basis.
