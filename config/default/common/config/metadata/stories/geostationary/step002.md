Each satellite covers a specific region of the Earth. The GOES-East satellite is centered on 75.2 degrees W covering the Conterminous US, Canada, Central and South America. eostationary satellites are an altitude of approximately 35,800km (22,300 miles) directly over the equator and revolve in the same direction (west to east) that the Earth rotates. This altitude ensures that one orbit takes 24 hours which is the same length of time as the Earth takes to rotate once on its axis.
