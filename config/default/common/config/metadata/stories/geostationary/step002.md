Worldview now also has imagery from several geostationary satellites. These satellites follow the Earth's rotation and travel at the same rate of the rotation, so from Earth, it appears the satellite is fixed in one location. This means the satellite captures the same view of Earth and provides almost continuous coverage of one area. Worldview has imagery from the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES)-East, GOES-West, and Himawari-8.
