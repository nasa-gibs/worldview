The Red Visible layer is used primarily to monitor the evolution of clouds throughout the daylight hours. It is also useful for identifying small-scale features such as river fog/clear air boundaries, or overshooting tops of cumulus clouds. It can also be used to identify daytime snow and ice cover, diagnose low-level cloud-drift winds, assist with detections of volcanic ash and analysis of hurricanes and winter storms. This imagery is at 1km resolution. Press "Play" to view Hurricane Dorian, a category 5 hurricane. The animation shows the storm's movement westward as the sun rises and illuminates Earth's surface.
