The Air Mass layer is used primarily for distinguishing between polar and tropical air masses, especially along frontal boundaries and to identify high, mid, and low-level clouds. It can also be used to infer cyclogenesis by identifying warm, dry, ozone-rich descending stratospheric air associated with jet streams and potential vorticity (PV) anomalies. This imagery is at 2 km resolution. This imagery is available on a rolling 30 day basis from the GOES-East, GOES-West, and Himawari-8 satellites. Typhoon Mindulle is shown here on 1 October 2021 at 00:00 UTC, approaching Japan. In the center of the storm are high thick clouds in white, the dark red/orange area on the western side of the storm are jet stream/PV/deformation zones/dry upper level, and the green tinted areas show warm air masses.
