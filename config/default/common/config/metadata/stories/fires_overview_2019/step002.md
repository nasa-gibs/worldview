Data collected by the satellites utilize an algorithm that exploits the strong emission of mid-infrared radiation from fires and thermal anomalies - these fires and thermal anomalies are shown here as red points. The points represent the center of a pixel within which one or multiple fires have occurred. For the MODIS instrument the point represents the center of a 1km pixel, for the VIIRS instrument the point represents the center of a 375m pixel. Using the eye icon, turn on and off the MODIS and VIIRS Day and Night time fire points to view the differences between the sources.
