Another useful layer is the Suomi NPP/OMPS Aerosol Index (PyroCumuloNimbus) layer which was developed to make it easier to track the extent and spread of PyroCumuloNimbus (pyroCb) and other high-aerosol events. The OMPS Aerosol Index (AI) layer detects AI values between 0 and 5, which is useful for typical smoke and dust events as shown in the previous step. Larger AI values between 5 and 10 usually indicate dense smoke from intensely burning fires that reach higher in the troposphere. Once the AI gets above 10, the smoke has likely been produced from a pyroCb event, with dense smoke lofted into the upper troposphere and, often, into the stratosphere. Here is an example from Russia on 3 August 2021. Hover over the AI layer to see the relevant AI values in the Layer List. Some values reach as high as 10.
