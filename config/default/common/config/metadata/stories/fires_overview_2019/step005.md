It's possible to see fires at night time too! Here we compare Black Marble Nighttime (Blue/Yellow) Composite (Day/Night Band) imagery from Suomi NPP/VIIRS for 9 and 10 August 2021 near Algiers, Algeria. Swipe back and forth to see the fires appear on the 10th. Turn on and off the fire layer on the right "B" side to see how the fire points corresponds to the yellow actively burning areas in the night time image composite. The other bright yellow areas are city lights which correspond to the city and town names.
