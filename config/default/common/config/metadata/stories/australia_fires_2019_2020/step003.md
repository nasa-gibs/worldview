The fires leave a mark on the landscape. In these false color images of Bands M11-I2-I1 from VIIRS/Suomi NPP, we show the difference between the landscapes, one year apart. The left "A" side shows vegetated land, in green, on 14 January 2019. The right "B" side shows the burn scars, in dark red, on 11 January 2020. Slide the bar back and forth to compare the two dates. Change the date on the right "B" side to 4 January 2020 to see the actively burning areas in bright red.
