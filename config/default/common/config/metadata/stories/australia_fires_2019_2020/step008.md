The fires are also visible at night. This Nighttime imagery layer from the Day/Night Band of the VIIRS instrument on board the joint NASA/NOAA Suomi NPP satellite captures natural and anthropogenic night time light emissions such as city lights, lightning, auroras, fires, gas flares, and fishing fleets. To discern the difference between the city lights and fires on 3 January 2020, turn on the VIIRS Fires and Thermal Anomalies (Night, 375m) layer and the Place Labels.
