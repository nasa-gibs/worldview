Smoke from these fires has been far reaching, drifting as far as South America. Here we see the Aerosol Index from the Ozone Mapping Profiler Suite (OMPS) instrument on board the joint NASA/NOAA Suomi NPP satellite on the 5th and 6th of January 2020. The Aerosol Index (PyroCumuloNimbus) layer indicates the presence of ultraviolet (UV)-absorbing particles in the air such as desert dust and soot particles in the atmosphere. This layer is useful for identifying and tracking high Aerosol Index value events and makes it easier to track the spread of high aerosol concentrations in the atmosphere.
