<p>We've selected Iceberg B15T from the event list. Zoom out and pan the map to see when and where the iceberg started by following the iceberg movement track. Click on the white dots on the track to change the imagery to that particular date. Sometimes you won't see any imagery and a "black hole" around the pole because if there is no sunlight and no reflected light off the surface of the earth, the sensor cannot capture an image of that area.</p>
