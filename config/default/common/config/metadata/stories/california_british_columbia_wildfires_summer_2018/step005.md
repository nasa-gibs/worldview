<p>Using the animation feature (video camera icon), we have set a date range of 1 month (July 27th until Aug 27th), and set the frames per second to "2", so we can easily observe changes over time. <br> Press the play button to play the animation. During the animation we can see small fires crop up and quickly expand to much larger clusters. You can use the loop button to watch the animation continuously and change the frames per second to speed up or slow down the animation.</p>
