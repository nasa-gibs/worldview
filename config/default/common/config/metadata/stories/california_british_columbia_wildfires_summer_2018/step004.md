<p>On 27 July 2018 there is no indication of fire or smoke. Using the animation feature (video camera icon), we have set a date range of 1 month (27 July to 27 August), and set the frames per second to "2", so we can easily observe changes over time. <br> Press the play button to play the animation. <br> We can see small fires crop up and quickly expand to much larger clusters with a lot of smoke from the fires. You can use the loop button to watch the animation continuously and change the frames per second to speed up or slow down the animation.</p>
