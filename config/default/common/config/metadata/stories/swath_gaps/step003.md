<p>When you view imagery from the newer sensor, the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), aboard the joint NASA/NOAA Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP) satellite and the NOAA-20 satellite there are no black swath gaps. The swath width is 3,040 km wide which enables an approximate 15% image overlap between consecutive orbits at the equator. These "ribbons" are much wider than the MODIS "ribbons".</p>
