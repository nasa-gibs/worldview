The Flood Product is generated for two compositing periods (2-Day and 3-Day) to help minimize the impact of clouds. Clouds both block the view, leading to false-negatives; and their shadows often look like water, leading to false-positives. Compositing over multiple days (2 or 3) and requiring more than one water detection helps minimize these issues. The 2-Day product requires a minimum of two water detections over available observations over 2 days, and the 3-Day requires 3 detections over 3 days. Water matching our reference water layer (MOD44W) is marked as surface water (cyan), and water not matching that is marked as flood (red). Grey pixels indicate insufficient clear data over the compositing period which is typically due to cloud cover.
