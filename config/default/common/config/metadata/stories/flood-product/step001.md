The MODIS Near Real-Time (NRT) Global Flood Product ([MCDWD](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/learn/find-data/near-real-time/modis-nrt-global-flood-product)) provides a daily global map of optically observed flooding. It is derived from the NRT MODIS Surface Reflectance (MOD09) datasets from both the Terra and Aqua satellites. Note that this product cannot detect water under persistent cloud cover.
