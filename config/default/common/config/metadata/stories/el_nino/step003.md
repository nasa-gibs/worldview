## What does El Niño impact?

The weakening and shift in Trade Winds in the Equatorial Pacific causes changes in sea level and sea surface
temperature, leading to ocean currents and atmospheric circulation spreading the varying impacts of El Niño such
as precipitation across the globe.

In this animation we can explore monthly SST anomalies (rainbow color bar) together with an overlaid precipitation
rate (blue-white-red color bar) during the last notable El Niño, May 2014 to May 2016.
