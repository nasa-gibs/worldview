## When was the last El Ni単o?
As of 2023, the last notable El Ni単o event was in 2015. This is a comparison of SST anomalies between October 22, 2015 (left "A" side) and October 22, 2023 (right "B" side). In 2015, an SST signature showing warmer than normal SSTs, known as "[The Blob](https://www.nps.gov/articles/theblob.htm)", was visible along the west coast of North America. 2023 does not appear to exhibit the same contemporaneous phenomenon.

While the Blob is not directly associated with El Ni単os, it caused significant [impacts](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/feature-story/looking-back-blob-record-warming-drives-unprecedented-ocean-change) across North America when it occured together with the 2015 El Ni単o.
