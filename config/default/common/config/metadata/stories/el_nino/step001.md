## What is El Niño anyway?

El Niño conditions are known to form when Trade Winds in the Equatorial Pacific, which usually blow from East to West, weaken or even reverse direction and blow from West to East. This transports warm water from the Western Pacific to the West Coast of South America, as evident by the higher sea surface temperature (SST) in the region.

For example, in October 2023 El Niño was noticeable in the Equatorial Pacific as seen in the SST anomaly for October 22nd, 2023 based on the Multi-Scale Ultra-High-Resolution (MUR) SST dataset. Deep red colors indicate SST increases of about 3℃ from normal conditions (climatology). Blue/purple colors indicate cooler SST temperatures compared to climatology.
