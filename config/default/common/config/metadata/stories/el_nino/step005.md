## Transition to La Niña

During La Niña conditions, SST anomalies in the Tropical Pacific transition from warm to cold temperatures. [NOAA](https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/analysis_monitoring/enso_advisory/ensodisc.shtml) predicted a near 60 percent chance of a weak La Niña developing in the fall of 2024 to winter of 2025. Current conditions (November 11, 2024) indicate SSTs have returned to more normal temperatures.
