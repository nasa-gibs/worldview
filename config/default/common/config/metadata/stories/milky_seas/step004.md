When bacterial colonies become large enough, they cause a steady and uniform whitish glow that emanate from the water and can cover thousands of square kilometers of ocean surface. This is unlike other more common marine bioluminecence like dinoflagellates, which flash when there is mechanical disturbance like in a ship's wake, or breaking waves. This bioluminescence is a defense mechanism to startle predators or draw the attention of larger predators.
