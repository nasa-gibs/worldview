Let's check and make sure the milky seas are not something else, like clouds. Shown here an opacity comparison of the Brightness Temperature (Band I5, Night) layer with the DNB layer. Both layers are at 50% opacity and the view currently shows the white milky sea in the center of the map from the DNB image and darker purple clouds surrounding the milky sea from the brightness temperature layer. Move the slider to the left "A" side to see the milky sea in the DNB layer. Move the slider to the right "B" side to see the dark purple clouds in the brightness temperature layer. Swipe the slider back and forth between A and B to see that the milky seas are not clouds and are unlike the surrounding cloud formations.
