When bacterial colonies become large enough, they cause a steady and uniform whitish glow that emanate from the water and can cover thousands of square kilometers of ocean surface. Press the "Play" button in the lower left corner to view the movement of the milky sea between July 28 and August 9, 2019. A yacht encountered this milky sea on August 2, 2019 and crew members aboard the *Ganesha* were able to [capture photographs](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2207612119) of the phenomena.

Milky seas are unlike other more common marine bioluminecence like dinoflagellates, which flash when there is mechanical disturbance like in a ship's wake, or breaking waves. These flash as a defense mechanism to startle predators or draw the attention of larger predators.
