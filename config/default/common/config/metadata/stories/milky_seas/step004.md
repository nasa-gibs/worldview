Let's double check and make sure the milky seas are not something else, like clouds. Shown here an opacity comparison of the Brightness Temperature (Band I5, Night) layer with the DNB layer. Both layers are at 50% opacity and the view currently shows the white milky sea in the center from the DNB image and darker purple clouds surrounding the milky sea from the brightness temperature layer. Move the slider to the DNB layer "A" side to see the milky sea. Move the slider to the brightness temperature layer "B" side to see the dark purple clouds. Swipe the slider back and forth between A and B to see that the milky seas are not clouds and are unlike the surrounding cloud formations.
