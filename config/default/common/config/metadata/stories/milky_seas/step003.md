This image from August 4, 2019, shows milky seas clearly visible off the southern coast of Java, and contrasts with the city lights on the island to the north. It is hypothesized that milky seas occur when colonies of microalgae like *Phaeocystis* become a substrate for colonization by the luminous bacterium (*V. harveyi*) and they produce a bioluminescent response to attract fish to consume it.
