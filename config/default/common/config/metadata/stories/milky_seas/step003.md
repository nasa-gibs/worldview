This image from the 4 August 2019, shows milky seas clearly visible off the southern coast of Java, and in contrast to the city lights on the island to the north. Milky seas occur when colonies of microalgae like *Phaocystis* become a substrate for colonization by the the luminous bacterium (*V. harveyi*) and they produce a bioluminescent response to attract fish to consume it. When bacterial colonies become large enough, they cause a steady and uniform whitish glow that emanate from the water and can cover thousands of square kilometers of ocean surface. This is unlike other more common marine bioluminecence like dinoflagellates, which flash when there is mechanical disturbance like in a ship's wake, or breaking waves. This bioluminescence is a defense mechanism to startle predators or draw the attention of larger predators.
