The 2021 study, [Honing in on bioluminescent milky seas from space](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-94823-z) has shown that the nighttime imagery from the Day/Night Band is a useful layer in pinpointing the location of milky seas. In the future, when more nighttime imagery is available it will be easier to spot these via satellite and research vessels can be tasked to sail out to study the bioluminescent phenomena!
