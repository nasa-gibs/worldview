Now we've added the Chlorophyll a layer from VIIRS/Suomi NPP from the daytime overpass to the right "B" side and kept the DNB layer on the left "A" side. This layer can be used as a proxy for the amount of organic material in the surface waters. Elevated chlorophyll concentrations (> 1 mg/m<sup>3</sup>) are shown in yellows to reds and occur directly adjacent to the milky sea. This may indicate regions of algal stress where bacteria would proliferate. Drag the slider back and forth to see the chlorohyll is adjacent to the milky sea and not part of the milky sea.
