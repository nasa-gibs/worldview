This elusive bioluminescent phenomena have been made somewhat easier to track remotely with low-light sensors, like the Day/Night Band (DNB) of the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) instrument aboard the joint NASA/NOAA Suomi National Polar orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP), NOAA-20, and NOAA-21 satellites. DNB is designed to look at sources of illumination including both natural and anthropogenic sources of light emissions. When there is no moonlight, city and highway lights, lightning, upper-atmospheric gravity waves, auroras, fires, gas flares, and fishing fleets are easily seen. When there is partial to full moon conditions, lunar reflection can be used to highlight the location and features of clouds and other terrestrial features such as sea ice and snow cover. Recent studies have shown that DNB can also be used to study milky seas.
