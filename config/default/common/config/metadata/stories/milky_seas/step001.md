Milky seas are a rare form of marine bioluminescence where the nocturnal ocean surface produces a widespread, uniform and steady whitish glow. Milky seas have been reported in a few regions - the northwest Indian Ocean, offshore of the Horn of Africa and the Maritime Continent which include the Indonesian waters around the island of Java, and the Banda Sea. They are most commonly found in areas with deep upwelling, high primary production, and warm surface waters, yet despite many areas worldwide exhibiting these characteristics, they are difficult to predict and find in the vast oceans.
