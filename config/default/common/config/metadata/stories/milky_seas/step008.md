This is another example from the Somalia Sea on January 20, 2018. We have changed the thresholds on the image to highlight the milky sea more clearly as it is quite faint. Turn on and off the Brightness Temperature (Band I5, Night) layer in the layer list and see that the milky sea is not cloud. CLouds are shown in dark purple as they are lower in temperature than the temperature of the ocean's surface.
