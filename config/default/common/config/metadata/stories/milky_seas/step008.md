This is another example from the Somalia Sea on January 20, 2018. We have changed the thresholds on the image to see the milky sea more clearly as it is quite faint. You can also turn on and off the Brightness Temperature (Band I5, Night) layer and see that the milky sea is not cloud, which are shown in dark purple as they are lower in temperature than the temperature of the ocean's surface.
