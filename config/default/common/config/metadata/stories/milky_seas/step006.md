To investigate this a little further, we've added the Sea Surface Temperature (Night, L2) from the VIIRS instrument aboard the Suomi NPP satellite to the right "B" side and the DNB layer remains on the left "A" side. Drag the slider back and forth to see that the eastern edge of the milky sea stops at an area of cooler water (shown in yellow) which is giving the milky sea its elongated shape.
