<p>On 2018 JUL 10, the crack in the
  ice shelf is not yet visible. At this
  zoom level, it is difficult to discern
  the location of the ice self in the
  antarctic. Let’s zoom out using the
  “-” icon. Click the icon 3 times to get
  an idea of where the iceberg is
  located on our Earth. </p>

<p>Experiment with using both zoom
  buttons to zoom in and out. Note
  the yellow overzoomed indicators
  present on some layers</p>
