The Black Marble Nighttime Blue/Yellow Composite (Day/Night Band) layer is a false color composite using VIIRS at-sensor radiance combined with brightness temperature from the M15 band which complements the At Sensor Radiance layer. This false color scheme produces nighttime city lights in shades of yellow with infrared, nighttime cloud presence in shades of blue. During bright moonlight conditions, moonlight reflected from cloud tops and the land surface may also provide a yellow hue to those features.
