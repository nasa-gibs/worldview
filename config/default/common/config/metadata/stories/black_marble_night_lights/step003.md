The layer is particularly useful for detecting city lights, lightning, auroras, fires, gas flares, and fishing fleets. Here you can see the brightly lit metropolis of Bangkok, Thailand. In addition to the city lights, there are also hundreds of squid fishing vessels in the Gulf of Thailand, just south of Bangkok, as well as the Andaman Sea, to the west. The lights on the boats are used to attract plankton and fish, which draw squid to the surface to feed.
