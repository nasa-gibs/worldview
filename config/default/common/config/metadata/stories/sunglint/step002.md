<p>You can see these sunglint areas in water bodies roughly in the center of each of these Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor/Terra satellite swaths. You may also be wondering what the black areas of missing imagery near the equator are too! This occurs with MODIS/Terra and MODIS/Aqua imagery because the swath width is only 2,330km wide.</p>
