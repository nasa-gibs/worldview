<p>Sometimes when you look at satellite imagery, you may see some areas with bright patches of light that make make some bodies of water look like they are shining. These shiny, mirror-like areas are caused by sunglint. This occurs when sunlight reflects off the surface of the water at the same angle that a satellite sensor views it. Bodies of water often have very irregular surfaces due to waves and currents, this causes the sunlight to be scattered in many different directions and it leaves a blurry area in the satellite imagery instead of a perfect reflection of the Sun.</p>
