<p>Sunglint can be an annoyance - researchers studying sediment in the water, ocean color or phytoplankton often have parts of imagery that are obscured due to sunglint, making it difficult to see what's happening in the water. In this comparison, the MODIS/Aqua image from 22 April 2019 on the left, shows sunglint over the Gulf of Martaban. The right "B" side shows 24 April 2019, if you move the swipe bar to the left, you can see the sediment in the gulf much more clearly because there aren't any effects of sunglint. </p>
