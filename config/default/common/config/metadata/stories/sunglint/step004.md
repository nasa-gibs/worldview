<p>Sun glint can be a curse or a blessing - researchers studying phytoplankton or ocean color often have parts of imagery that are obscured for them due to the sun glint, making it difficult to see what's happening in the water. In this MODIS/Aqua image from 22 April 2019 on the left, there is sun glint over the Gulf of Martaban. On the right "B" side you can see the sediment in the gulf is much more visible on the 24th. </p>
