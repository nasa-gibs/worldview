<p>Sun glint can also be useful for highlighting interesting details in the water. Oil from oil spills or natural oil seeps can be visible because a layer of oil smooths the water surface. This example from 17 May 2010 shows the resulting oil spill from the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig explosion.
