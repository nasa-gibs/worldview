Since April 2023, near-global Dynamic Surface Water eXtent (DSWx) at 30 meter resolution has been available in Worldview through the Observational Products for End-Users from Remote Sensing Analysis (OPERA) project. The Level-3 product maps surface water every few days. Based on Harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2 (HLS) inputs, the water (WTR) layer has 5 classes: Not Water, Open Water, Partial Surface Water, HLS Snow/Ice, and HLS Cloud/Cloud Shadow. DSWx-HLS currently includes data from NASA/USGS Landsat 8, and ESA Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B satellites.
