Near-global surface water extent at 30 meter resolution is available in Worldview through the Observational Products for End-Users from Remote Sensing Analysis (OPERA) project. The Level-3 product maps surface water every few days. The layer has 5 classifications: Not Water, Open Water, Partial Surface Water, Snow/Ice, and Cloud. The input dataset is the Harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2 (HLS) dataset, and currently uses data from Landsat 8, Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B.
