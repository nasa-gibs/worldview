The Indus River Valley receives heavy monsoon rains each summer which contribute to the appearance of extensive surface water. These false-color reflectance images from Landsat 8 show water in dark blues. The left image is from 3 May 2023, before the monsoon rains, and the right side is from 7 August 2023. Swiping the bar back and forth reveals the extent of floodwaters along the riverbanks and in the surrounding region.
