The Laguna de Aculeo is a two hours' drive from Santiago, Chile and was a long-time popular summer vacationing spot to go boating, swimming, and water skiing. A combination of nearby population growth, purchasing of water rights for agriculture, and drought caused the shallow lake to go dry in 2018. This true-color reflectance image from 18 May 2023 from the European Space Agency's (ESA) Sentinel-2A and -2B satellites show a dry lake bed in shades of brown in the center of the map.
