The Laguna de Aculeo is a two-hour drive from Santiago, Chile and was a long-time popular summer vacation spot for boating, swimming, and water skiing. A combination of nearby population growth, purchasing of water rights for agriculture, and drought caused the shallow lake to go dry in 2018. This Landsat 8 true-color reflectance image from 18 May 2023 shows a dry lake bed in shades of brown in the center of the view.
