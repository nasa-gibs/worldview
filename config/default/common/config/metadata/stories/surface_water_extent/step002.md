**Laguna de Aculeo, Chile**
The lake is a two hours' drive from Santiago, Chile and was a long-time popular summer vacationing spot to go boating, swimming, and water skiing. A combination of nearby population growth, purchasing of water rights for agriculture, and drought caused the shallow lake to go dry in 2018.
