Worldview has been consistently providing daily, global satellite imagery from polar orbiting satellites like the joint NASA/NOAA Suomi NPP, but Worldview is moving into new territory - supplying satellite imagery every 10 minutes from geostationary satellites like GOES-East (currently, GOES-R/GOES-16), GOES-West (currently, GOES-T/GOES-18) and Himawari-8!
