The joint NASA/NOAA Suomi-NPP Polar-orbiting satellite VIIRS instrument captured this Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Corrected Reflectance image at approximately 18:35 UTC of Hurricane Dorian as it made landfall on the Bahamas on 1 September 2019.

Worldview has been consistently providing daily, global satellite imagery from polar orbiting satellites, but Worldview is moving into new territory - supplying satellite imagery every 10 minutes from geostationary satellites like GOES East, GOES West and Himawari-8!
