The ASTER Global Digital Elevation Model (GDEM) Color Index layer shows land elevation around the world, measured in meters. On the default palette, white indicates the highest elevations, then brown, yellow and greens indicate low elevations.

The Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) instrument is on board the Terra satellite. The ASTER GDEM (version 2) is a static product. It was created from approximately  1.5 million scenes (ASTER stereo pair observations) dating back to 2000 and covers land surfaces between 83°N and 83°S. ASTER GDEM data have a resolution of 30 meters.
