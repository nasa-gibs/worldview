The Last of the Wild, 1995-2004 layer of the Last of the Wild Project, Version 2, 2005 (LWP-2) is derived from the LWP-2 Human Footprint Dataset. The gridded data are classified according to their raster value (wild = 0-10; not wild > 10). The ten largest polygons of more than 5 square kilometers within each biome by realm are selected and identified. The dataset in Clarke 1866 Geographic Coordinate System is produced by the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) and the Columbia University Center for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN).

The purpose of the data set is to provide an updated map of wild areas in geographic projection which can be used in wildlife conservation planning, natural resource management, and research on human-environment interactions.
