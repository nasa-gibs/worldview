### Power Plants, Nuclear
The Nuclear Power Plants layer indicates the location of nuclear power plants across the world. It is part of the Population Exposure Estimates in Proximity to Nuclear Power Plants database, Version 1.

The nuclear power plants locations data set combines information from a global data set developed by Declan Butler of Nature News and the Power Reactor Information System (PRIS), an up-to-date database of nuclear reactors maintained by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The locations of nuclear reactors around the world are represented as point features associated with reactor specification and performance history attributes as of March 2012 (1956 - 2012).

The layer can be viewed in Worldview/Global Imagery Browse Services (GIBS) and the data can be downloaded from the [Socioeconomic Data and Applications Center (SEDAC)](http://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/data/set/energy-pop-exposure-nuclear-plants-locations).
