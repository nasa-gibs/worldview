### Forests, Mangrove
The Mangrove Forests layer indicates the presence of mangrove forests across the world.

The Global Mangrove Forests Distribution, 2000 data set is a compilation of the extent of mangroves forests from the Global Land Survey and the Landsat archive with hybrid supervised and unsupervised digital image classification techniques. The data are available at 30m spatial resolution. The total area of mangroves in the year 2000 was estimated at 137,760 km2 in 118 countries and territories in the tropical and subtropical regions of the world.
