The MOPITT Carbon Monoxide (Level 2, Daily, Day/Night, Total Column) layer shows the amount of carbon monoxide (CO) present in the total vertical column of the lower atmosphere (troposphere) and is measured in mole per square centimeter (mol/cm<sup>2</sup>) for the Day and Night overpasses, in near real-time. MOPITT Near Real Time (NRT) measurements use thermal-infrared radiation at 4.7 Âµm to produce CO total column abundance.

The MOPITT Carbon Monoxide (L2, Daily, Day/Night, Total Column) layer is available from the Measurements of Pollution in the Troposphere (MOPITT) instrument on the Terra satellite. The sensor resolution is 22 km at nadir, imagery resolution is 2 km, and the temporal resolution is daily.
