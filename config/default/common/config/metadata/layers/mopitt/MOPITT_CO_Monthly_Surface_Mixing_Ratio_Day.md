The MOPITT Carbon Monoxide (CO) (Monthly, Day, Surface Mixing Ratio) layer shows the amount of carbon monoxide present at the Earthâ€™s surface in the lower atmosphere (troposphere) and is measured in parts per billion by volume (ppbv).

The MOPITT Carbon Monoxide (Monthly, Day, Surface Mixing Ratio) layer is available from the Measurements of Pollution in the Troposphere (MOPITT) instrument on the Terra satellite. The sensor resolution is 22 km at nadir, imagery resolution is 2 km, and the temporal resolution is monthly.
