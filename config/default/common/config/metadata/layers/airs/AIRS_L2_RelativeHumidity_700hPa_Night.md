#### Description
Relative humidity of the air in units of percent at the 700 hPa pressure level, approximately 3000 meters (10,000 feet) above sea level. Relative humidity is the ratio of the amount of water vapor in air to the total amount of water vapor the air can hold at specified temperature and pressure. Warm air can hold more water vapor than cold air, so the same amount of water vapor results in higher relative humidity in cool air than in warm air. AIRS relative humidity is derived from AIRS temperature and water vapor and is calculated as the fraction of retrieved humidity mixing ratio and temperature-dependent saturation mixing ratios. Roughly one third of the mass of Earth's atmosphere is found between the surface and this level. This level reflects wind patterns that steer individual thunderstorms, so it is often used by meteorologists for predicting thunderstorm motion and intensification.

#### About AIRS
AIRS, in conjunction with the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU), senses emitted infrared and microwave radiation from Earth to provide a three-dimensional look at Earth's weather and climate. Working in tandem, the two instruments make simultaneous observations down to Earth's surface. With more than 2,000 channels sensing different regions of the atmosphere, the system creates a global, three-dimensional map of atmospheric temperature and humidity, cloud amounts and heights, greenhouse gas concentrations and many other atmospheric phenomena. Launched into Earth orbit in 2002, the AIRS and AMSU instruments fly onboard NASA's Aqua spacecraft and are managed by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.
