#### Description
Sulfur dioxide (SO2) brightness temperature difference is calculated by subtracting brightness temperature values reported in two AIRS channels, one that is sensitive to SO2 and one that is not. A large difference implies greater SO2 absorption. Note that clouds can block the detection of the SO2 signal by the AIRS instrument. Sulfur dioxide can also be emitted from volcanic eruptions. Volcanic SO2 absorbs the energy in passing infrared wavelengths of light, or radiances, in transit from the surface of the Earth to space. This absorption is controlled by the types and quantities of the components within the plume, together with other factors such as cloud cover, surface temperature and emissivity.

#### About AIRS
AIRS, in conjunction with the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU), senses emitted infrared and microwave radiation from Earth to provide a three-dimensional look at Earth's weather and climate. Working in tandem, the two instruments make simultaneous observations down to Earth's surface. With more than 2,000 channels sensing different regions of the atmosphere, the system creates a global, three-dimensional map of atmospheric temperature and humidity, cloud amounts and heights, greenhouse gas concentrations and many other atmospheric phenomena. Launched into Earth orbit in 2002, the AIRS and AMSU instruments fly onboard NASA's Aqua spacecraft and are managed by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.
