#### Description
Temperature of the solid or liquid surface of the Earth in units of Kelvin (K). Skin temperature refers to the temperature of the surface layer of the Earth, in contrast to the air temperature above the ground. Unlike temperatures in the atmosphere at higher altitudes, surface skin temperature can experience large changes between day and night due to solar heating.

#### Image Resolution
32 km/pixel (AIRS Level 2 data is nominally 45 km/pixel at the equator and the data has been resampled into a 32 km/pixel visualization.)

#### Data Product
Image initially produced with NRT data. Science quality image replaces NRT when available.<br>
