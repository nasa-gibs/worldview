#### Description
Cloud top altitude is the log-pressure altitude calculated from the retrieved AIRS cloud top pressure assuming a surface pressure of 1000 hPa and a scale height of 6 kilometers. These are the approximate altitudes where clouds have infrared optical depths of unity. AIRS can sense up to two cloud decks in a column of atmosphere, but in this plot only the higher of the two decks is depicted.

#### Image Resolution
32 km/pixel (AIRS Level 2 `PCldTopStd` is nominally 13.5km/pixel, the data has been resampled into a 32 km/pixel visualization.)

#### Data Product
Image initially produced with NRT data. Science quality image replaces NRT when available.<br>

#### About AIRS
AIRS, in conjunction with the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU), senses emitted infrared and microwave radiation from Earth to provide a three-dimensional look at Earth's weather and climate. Working in tandem, the two instruments make simultaneous observations down to Earth's surface. With more than 2,000 channels sensing different regions of the atmosphere, the system creates a global, three-dimensional map of atmospheric temperature and humidity, cloud amounts and heights, greenhouse gas concentrations and many other atmospheric phenomena. Launched into Earth orbit in 2002, the AIRS and AMSU instruments fly onboard NASA's Aqua spacecraft and are managed by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.
