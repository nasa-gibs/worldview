The Total Cloud Fraction (Day) layer is the product of cloud fractional coverage and cloud infrared emissivity. Low fraction can indicate either small, highly emissive clouds or more extensive but less emissive clouds. While AIRS can sense up to two cloud decks in a column of atmosphere, this plot shows the cloud fraction of all cloud decks present.

#### Image Resolution
32 km/pixel (AIRS Level 2 `CldFrcStd` is nominally 13.5 km/pixel, the data has been resampled into a 32 km/pixel visualization.)

#### Data Product
Image initially produced with NRT data. Science quality image replaces NRT when available.<br>
Near Real-Time Product: `AIRS2RET_NRT` (Aqua/AIRS L2 Near Real Time (NRT) Standard Physical Retrieval (AIRS-only) V7.0 at GES DISC)<br>
Science Quality Product: `AIRS2RET` (Aqua/AIRS L2 Standard Physical Retrieval (AIRS-only) V7.0 at GES DISC)<br>
Field name: `CldFrcStd` (sum of 2 cloud decks)<br>
Resolution: 13.5 km/pixel at nadir

#### Coverage
Spatial Coverage: Global<br>
Overpasses: Twice daily (day and night)<br>
Orbit: Sun-synchronous polar; Equatorial crossing local time: Daytime 1:30 pm, Nighttime 1:30 am

Note: For the Arctic (EPSG:3413) and Antarctic (EPSG:3031) projections, there is no differentation between the Day and the Night layers, they both show the same imagery.
