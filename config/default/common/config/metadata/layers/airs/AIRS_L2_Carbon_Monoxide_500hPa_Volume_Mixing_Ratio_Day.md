The Carbon Monoxide (L2, 500hPa, Day) layer displays carbon monoxide in units of parts per billion by volume at the 500 hPa pressure level, approximately 5500 meters (18,000 feet) above sea level.

#### Image Resolution
32 km/pixel (AIRS Level 2 data is nominally 45 km/pixel at the equator and the data has been resampled into a 32 km/pixel visualization.)

#### Data Product
Image initially produced with NRT data. Science quality image replaces NRT when available.<br>
Near Real-Time Product: `AIRS2RET_NRT` (AIRS-Only Level 2 Near Real-Time Product) Version 7<br>
Science Quality Product: `AIRS2RET` (AIRS-Only Level 2 Standard Product) Version 6<br>
Field name: `COVMRLevStd`; pressure level is at element 7<br>
