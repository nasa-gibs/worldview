#### Description
Air temperature in units of kelvin at the 700 hPa pressure level, approximately 3000 meters (10,000 feet) above sea level. Roughly one third of the mass of Earth's atmosphere is found between Earth's surface and this level. This level reflects wind patterns that steer individual thunderstorms, so it is often used by meteorologists for predicting thunderstorm motion and intensification.

#### Image Resolution
Nominal equatorial image resolution 31.25 km/pixel; imagery displayed in Worldview/Global Imagery Browse Services (GIBS) is 2 km.

#### Data Product
Image initially produced with NRT data. Science quality image replaces NRT when available.  
Near Real-Time Product: `AIRS2RET_NRT` (AIRS-Only Level 2 Near Real-Time Product)  
Science Quality Product: `AIRS2RET` (AIRS-Only Level 2 Standard Product)

#### About AIRS
AIRS, in conjunction with the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU), senses emitted infrared and microwave radiation from Earth to provide a three-dimensional look at Earth's weather and climate. Working in tandem, the two instruments make simultaneous observations down to Earth's surface. With more than 2,000 channels sensing different regions of the atmosphere, the system creates a global, three-dimensional map of atmospheric temperature and humidity, cloud amounts and heights, greenhouse gas concentrations and many other atmospheric phenomena. Launched into Earth orbit in 2002, the AIRS and AMSU instruments fly onboard NASA's Aqua spacecraft and are managed by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.
