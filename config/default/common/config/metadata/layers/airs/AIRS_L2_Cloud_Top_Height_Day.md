The Cloud Top Height (L2, Day) layer is the log-pressure altitude calculated from the retrieved AIRS cloud top pressure assuming a surface pressure of 1000 hPa and a scale height of 6 kilometers. These are the approximate altitudes where clouds have infrared optical depths of unity. AIRS can sense up to two cloud decks in a column of atmosphere, but in this plot only the higher of the two decks is depicted.

#### Image Resolution
32 km/pixel (AIRS Level 2 `PCldTopStd` is nominally 13.5km/pixel, the data has been resampled into a 32 km/pixel visualization.)

#### Data Product
Image initially produced with NRT data. Science quality image replaces NRT when available.<br>
Near Real-Time Product: `AIRS2RET_NRT` (Aqua/AIRS L2 Near Real Time (NRT) Standard Physical Retrieval (AIRS-only) V7.0 at GES DISC)<br>
Science Quality Product: `AIRS2RET` (Aqua/AIRS L2 Standard Physical Retrieval (AIRS-only) V7.0 at GES DISC)<br>
Field name: `PCldTopStd`<br>
Resolution: 13.5 km/pixel at nadir

#### Coverage
Spatial Coverage: Global<br>
Overpasses: Twice daily (day and night)<br>
Orbit: Sun-synchronous polar; Equatorial crossing local time: Daytime 1:30 pm, Nighttime 1:30 am

Note: For the Arctic (EPSG:3413) and Antarctic (EPSG:3031) projections, there is no differentation between the Day and the Night layers, they both show the same imagery.
