The Total Cloud Fraction (Night) layer is the product of cloud fractional coverage and cloud infrared emissivity. Low fraction can indicate either small, highly emissive clouds or more extensive but less emissive clouds. While AIRS can sense up to two cloud decks in a column of atmosphere, this plot shows the cloud fraction of all cloud decks present.

#### Image Resolution
32 km/pixel (AIRS Level 2 `CldFrcStd` is nominally 13.5 km/pixel, the data has been resampled into a 32 km/pixel visualization.)
