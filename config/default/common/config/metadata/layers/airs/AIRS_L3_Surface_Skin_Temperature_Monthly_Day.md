The Surface Skin Temperature (L3, Day, Monthly) layer displays the temperature of the solid or liquid surface of the Earth in units of Kelvin (K). Skin temperature refers to the temperature of the surface layer of the Earth, in contrast to the air temperature above the ground. Unlike temperatures in the atmosphere at higher altitudes, surface skin temperature can experience large changes between day and night due to solar heating.ature is an essential climate variable widely used in studies of meteorology, climate, and environmental health applications.
