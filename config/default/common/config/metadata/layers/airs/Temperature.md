### Temperature (L2, 500 hPa, Day | Night)
Temporal coverage: 30 August 2002 - Present

#### Description
Air temperature in units of Kelvin (K) at the 500 hPa pressure level, approximately 5500 meters (18,000 feet) above sea level. The 500 hPa pressure level is near the divide between upper and lower halves of atmospheric mass and is often referred to as a steering level. Many midlatitude weather systems between this level and the Earth's surface move in roughly the same direction as winds at the 500 hPa level.

#### Image Resolution
Nominal equatorial image resolution 31.25 km/pixel; imagery displayed in Worldview/Global Imagery Browse Services (GIBS) is 2 km.

#### Data Product
Image initially produced with NRT data. Science quality image replaces NRT when available.

### Temperature (L2, 700 hPa, Day | Night)
Temporal coverage: 30 August 2002 - Present

#### Description
Air temperature in units of Kelvin (K) at the 700 hPa pressure level, approximately 3000 meters (10,000 feet) above sea level. Roughly one third of the mass of Earth's atmosphere is found between Earth's surface and this level. This level reflects wind patterns that steer individual thunderstorms, so it is often used by meteorologists for predicting thunderstorm motion and intensification.

### Surface Air Temperature (L2, Day | Night)
Temporal coverage: 30 August 2002 - Present

#### Description
Temperature of the air in units of Kelvin (K) two meters above sea level. Near-surface air temperature is an essential climate variable widely used in studies of meteorology, climate, and environmental health applications.

### Surface Skin Temperature (L2, Day | Night)
Temporal coverage: 30 August 2002 - Present

#### Description
Temperature of the solid or liquid surface of the Earth in units of Kelvin (K). Skin temperature refers to the temperature of the surface layer of the Earth, in contrast to the air temperature above the ground. Unlike temperatures in the atmosphere at higher altitudes, surface skin temperature can experience large changes between day and night due to solar heating.

#### About AIRS
AIRS, in conjunction with the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU), senses emitted infrared and microwave radiation from Earth to provide a three-dimensional look at Earth's weather and climate. Working in tandem, the two instruments make simultaneous observations down to Earth's surface. With more than 2,000 channels sensing different regions of the atmosphere, the system creates a global, three-dimensional map of atmospheric temperature and humidity, cloud amounts and heights, greenhouse gas concentrations and many other atmospheric phenomena. Launched into Earth orbit in 2002, the AIRS and AMSU instruments fly onboard NASA's Aqua spacecraft and are managed by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.
