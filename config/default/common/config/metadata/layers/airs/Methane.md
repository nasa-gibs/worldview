### About Methane
Methane is emitted during the production and transport of coal, natural gas, and oil. Methane emissions also result from livestock and other agricultural practices, and by the decay of organic waste. Wildfires also contribute to methane emissions. Methane concentration is higher in the northern hemisphere because most sources (both natural and human) are located on land. Known sources of methane are predominantly located near Earth's surface, but with vertical atmospheric mixing and methane's approximate 9-year lifetime it is considered to be a well-mixed gas (meaning the concentration of methane is taken to be constant with respect to height within the troposphere). Methane concentrations can vary seasonally.

### About AIRS
AIRS, in conjunction with the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU), senses emitted infrared and microwave radiation from Earth to provide a three-dimensional look at Earth's weather and climate. Working in tandem, the two instruments make simultaneous observations down to Earth's surface. With more than 2,000 channels sensing different regions of the atmosphere, the system creates a global, three-dimensional map of atmospheric temperature and humidity, cloud amounts and heights, greenhouse gas concentrations and many other atmospheric phenomena. Launched into Earth orbit in 2002, the AIRS and AMSU instruments fly onboard NASA's Aqua spacecraft and are managed by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.
