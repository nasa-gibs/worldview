The Methane (L2, 400 hPa, Day) layer displays atmospheric methane in units of parts per billion by volume at the 400 hPa pressure level, approximately 7200 meters (24,000 feet) above sea level.

#### Image Resolution
32 km/pixel (AIRS Level 2 data is nominally 45 km/pixel at the equator and the data has been resampled into a 32 km/pixel visualization.)

#### Data Product
Image initially produced with NRT data. Science quality image replaces NRT when available.<br>
Near Real-Time Product: `AIRS2RET_NRT` (Aqua/AIRS L2 Near Real Time (NRT) Standard Physical Retrieval (AIRS-only) V7.0 at GES DISC)<br>
Science Quality Product: `AIRS2RET` (Aqua/AIRS L2 Standard Physical Retrieval (AIRS-only) V7.0 at GES DISC)<br>
Field name: `CH4VMRLevStd`; pressure level at element 8<br>
Resolution: 45 km/pixel at nadir

#### Coverage
Spatial Coverage: Global<br>
Overpasses: Twice daily (day and night)<br>
Orbit: Sun-synchronous polar; Equatorial crossing local time: Daytime 1:30 pm, Nighttime 1:30 am

Note: For the Arctic (EPSG:3413) and Antarctic (EPSG:3031) projections, there is no differentation between the Day and the Night layers, they both show the same imagery.
