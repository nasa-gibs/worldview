The Relative Humidity (L2, 800 hPa, Night) layer displays relative humidity in units of per cent at the 850 hPa pressure, approximately 1500 meters (5000 feet) above sea level and often just above the boundary layer. Relative humidity is a measurement of water vapor relative to the temperature of the air and it is dependent upon temperature and pressure. Warm air can hold more water vapor than cold air, so the same amount of water vapor results in higher relative humidity in cool air than in warm air. The higher the relative humidity, the more moist the air, which is vital for the development of clouds and precipitation. AIRS relative humidity is derived from AIRS temperature and water vapor and it's calculated as ratios of retrieved specific humidity mixing ratios and temperature-dependent saturation mixing ratios. AIRS relative humidity is relative to the stable phase of water, taking into account the phase change from liquid to ice in a freezing layer.
