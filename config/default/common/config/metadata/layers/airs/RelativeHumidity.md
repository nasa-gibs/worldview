### Relative Humidity (L2, 500 hPa, Day | Night)
Temporal coverage: 30 August 2002 - Present

#### Description
Relative humidity of the air in units of percent at the 500 hPa pressure level, approximately 5500 meters (18,000 feet) above sea level. Relative humidity is the ratio of the amount of water vapor in air to the total amount of water vapor the air can hold at specified temperature and pressure. Warm air can hold more water vapor than cold air, so the same amount of water vapor results in higher relative humidity in cool air than in warm air. AIRS relative humidity is derived from AIRS temperature and water vapor and is calculated as the fraction of retrieved humidity mixing ratio and temperature-dependent saturation mixing ratios.  The 500 hPa pressure level is near the divide between upper and lower halves of atmospheric mass and is often referred to as a steering level. Many midlatitude weather systems between this level and the Earth's surface move in roughly the same direction as winds at the 500 hPa level.

### Relative Humidity (L2, 700 hPa, Day | Night)
Temporal coverage: 30 August 2002 - Present

#### Description
Relative humidity of the air in units of percent at the 700 hPa pressure level, approximately 3000 meters (10,000 feet) above sea level. Relative humidity is the ratio of the amount of water vapor in air to the total amount of water vapor the air can hold at specified temperature and pressure. Warm air can hold more water vapor than cold air, so the same amount of water vapor results in higher relative humidity in cool air than in warm air. AIRS relative humidity is derived from AIRS temperature and water vapor and is calculated as the fraction of retrieved humidity mixing ratio and temperature-dependent saturation mixing ratios. Roughly one third of the mass of Earth's atmosphere is found between the surface and this level. This level reflects wind patterns that steer individual thunderstorms, so it is often used by meteorologists for predicting thunderstorm motion and intensification.

### Relative Humidity (L2, 850 hPa, Day | Night)
Temporal coverage: 30 August 2002 - Present

#### Description
Relative humidity in units of per cent at the 850 hPa pressure, approximately 1500 meters (5000 feet) above sea level and often just above the boundary layer. Relative humidity is a measurement of water vapor relative to the temperature of the air and it is dependent upon temperature and pressure. Warm air can hold more water vapor than cold air, so the same amount of water vapor results in higher relative humidity in cool air than in warm air. The higher the relative humidity, the more moist the air, which is vital for the development of clouds and precipitation. AIRS relative humidity is derived from AIRS temperature and water vapor and it's calculated as ratios of retrieved specific humidity mixing ratios and temperature-dependent saturation mixing ratios. AIRS relative humidity is relative to the stable phase of water, taking into account the phase change from liquid to ice in a freezing layer.

### Surface Relative Humidity (L2, Day | Night)
Temporal coverage: 30 August 2002 - Present

#### Description
Relative humidity of air in units of percent, located two meters (6.5 feet) above sea level. Relative humidity is the ratio of the amount of water vapor in air to the total amount of water vapor the air can hold at specified temperature and pressure. Warm air can hold more water vapor than cold air, so the same amount of water vapor results in higher relative humidity in cool air than in warm air. AIRS relative humidity is derived from AIRS temperature and water vapor and is calculated as the fraction of retrieved humidity mixing ratio and temperature-dependent saturation mixing ratios.

#### About AIRS
AIRS, in conjunction with the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU), senses emitted infrared and microwave radiation from Earth to provide a three-dimensional look at Earth's weather and climate. Working in tandem, the two instruments make simultaneous observations down to Earth's surface. With more than 2,000 channels sensing different regions of the atmosphere, the system creates a global, three-dimensional map of atmospheric temperature and humidity, cloud amounts and heights, greenhouse gas concentrations and many other atmospheric phenomena. Launched into Earth orbit in 2002, the AIRS and AMSU instruments fly onboard NASA's Aqua spacecraft and are managed by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.
