The Surface Relative Humidity (L2, Night) layer displays relative humidity of air in units of percent, located two meters (6.5 feet) above sea level.

#### Image Resolution
32 km/pixel (AIRS Level 2 data is nominally 45 km/pixel at the equator and the data has been resampled into a 32 km/pixel visualization.)

#### Data Product
Image initially produced with NRT data. Science quality image replaces NRT when available.<br>
