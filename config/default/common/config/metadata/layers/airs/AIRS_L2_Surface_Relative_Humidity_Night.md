The Surface Relative Humidity (L2, Night) layer displays relative humidity of air in units of percent, located two meters (6.5 feet) above sea level.

#### Image Resolution
32 km/pixel (AIRS Level 2 data is nominally 45 km/pixel at the equator and the data has been resampled into a 32 km/pixel visualization.)

#### Data Product
Image initially produced with NRT data. Science quality image replaces NRT when available.<br>
Near Real-Time Product: `AIRS2RET_NRT` (Aqua/AIRS L2 Near Real Time (NRT) Standard Physical Retrieval (AIRS-only) V7.0 at GES DISC)<br>
Science Quality Product: `AIRS2RET` (Aqua/AIRS L2 Standard Physical Retrieval (AIRS-only) V7.0 at GES DISC)<br>
Field name: `RelHumSurf`<br>
Resolution: 45 km/pixel at nadir

Spatial Coverage: Global<br>
Overpasses: Twice daily (day and night)<br>
Orbit: Sun-synchronous polar; Equatorial crossing local time: Daytime 1:30 pm, Nighttime 1:30 am

Note: For the Arctic (EPSG:3413) and Antarctic (EPSG:3031) projections, there is no differentation between the Day and the Night layers, they both show the same imagery.
