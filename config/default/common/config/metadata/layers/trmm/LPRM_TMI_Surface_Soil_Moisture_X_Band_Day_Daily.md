The Surface Soil Moisture X-band (Day, Daily) layer displays level 3, daily, gridded surface soil moisture for the daytime overpass. The surface soil moisture information is derived from passive microwave remote sensing data from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Microwave Imager (TMI), using the Land Parameter Retrieval Model (LPRM). The LPRM is based on a forward radiative transfer model to retrieve surface soil moisture and vegetation optical depth.

The spatial resolution is 25 km x 25 km, the imagery resolution is 2 km and temporal availability is daily, covering the period from December 1997 to April 2015.
