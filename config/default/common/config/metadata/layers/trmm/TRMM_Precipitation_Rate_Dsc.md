The Precipitation Rate (Descending) layer displays rain rate and snow rate measured in millimeters per hour (mm/hr). The layer shows both the Rain Rate and Snow Rate with two different legends. This layer provides snapshots of individual storms, including tropical cyclones and flood-producing systems.

This layer is created from the new (GPM-formatted) TRMM product and replaces the old TRMM_2A12. Version 07 is the current version of the data set. The 2AGPROF (Goddard Profiling) algorithm is developed on GPM/GMI data, then modified to retrieve consistent precipitation and related science fields from other passive microwave sensors. This dataset features 2AGPROF retrievals from TRMM/TMI.

The spatial resolution is 13 km x 5 km, the imagery resolution is 2 km and temporal availability is daily.
