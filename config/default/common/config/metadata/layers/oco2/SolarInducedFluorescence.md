### About Solar Induced Chlorophyll Fluorescence
Solar Induced Chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF) is a byproduct of plant photosynthesis and is a direct measurement of plant response during respiration. During photosynthesis, among the other light reactions, a photon can be re-emitted and this energy decay is known as chlorophyll fluorescence.  IF is a complement to existing greenness indicators such as the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and can be used to serve as a functional proxy for Gross Primary Productivity (GPP).

### About OCO0-2
The Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) is a three-channel imaging grating spectrometer that primarily collects cloud-free XCO<sub>2</sub> observations continuously over the globe by measuring reflected sunlight in the near-infrared.
