The OCO-2 Carbon Dioxide (Difference from Global Mean) is a layer that combines OCO-2 XCO<sub>2</sub> (column-averaged dry-air mole fraction) and an estimated daily global trend XCO<sub>2</sub> value that is produced by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Earth System Research Laboratory Global Monitoring Division (NOAA ESRL GMD). It is calculated from daily averaged CO<sub>2</sub> data from four surface stations and is subtracted from the OCO-2 XCO<sub>2</sub> in order to provide a product that visualizes smaller variations in XCO<sub>2</sub> than the raw XCO<sub>2</sub> product. This is done because increasing atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations has resulted in a large range of XCO<sub>2</sub> values over the OCO-2 record.
