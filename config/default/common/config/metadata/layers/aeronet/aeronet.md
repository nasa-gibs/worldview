### About AERONET
The [AERONET](https://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov/new_web/index.html) (AErosol RObotic NETwork) program is a federation of ground-based remote sensing aerosol networks established by [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/) and [PHOTONS](https://www-loa.univ-lille1.fr/photons) (PHOtométrie pour le Traitement Opérationnel de Normalisation Satellitaire; [Univ. of Lille 1](http://www.univ-lille1.fr/), [CNES](http://www.cnes.fr/), and [CNRS-INSU](http://www.cnrs.fr/)) and is greatly expanded by networks (e.g., [RIMA](https://www.caelis.uva.es/rima/), [AeroSpan](https://research.csiro.au/acc/capabilities/aerospan/), [AEROCAN](http://www.aerocanonline.com/), [AEROSPAIN](https://aerospain.aemet.es/), [NEON](https://www.neonscience.org/), [NCU](https://www.ncu.edu.tw/en/index.html), and CARSNET) and [collaborators](https://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov/new_web/collaborators.html) from national agencies, institutes, universities, individual scientists, and partners. For more than 25 years, the project has provided long-term, continuous, and readily accessible public domain database of aerosol optical, microphysical and radiative properties for aerosol research and characterization, validation of satellite retrievals, and synergism with other databases. The network imposes standardization of [instruments](https://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov/new_web/system_descriptions_instrument.html), [calibration](https://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov/new_web/system_descriptions_calibration.html), [processing](https://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov/new_web/system_descriptions_processing.html) and [distribution](https://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov/new_web/system_descriptions_distribution.html).

AERONET collaboration provides globally distributed observations of spectral aerosol optical depth (AOD), inversion products, and precipitable water in diverse aerosol regimes. Version 3 AOD data are computed for three data quality levels: Level 1.0 (unscreened), Level 1.5 (cloud-screened and quality-controlled), and Level 2.0 (quality-assured). Inversions, precipitable water, and other AOD-dependent products are derived from these levels and may implement additional quality checks.
