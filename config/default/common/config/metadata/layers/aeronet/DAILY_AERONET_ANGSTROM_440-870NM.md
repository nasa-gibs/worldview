The AERONET Angstrom Parameter 440-870nm (Daily) layer provides the Angstrom parameter from the Level 1.5 data for AERONET ground-based remote sensing aerosol network sites. The angstrom parameter provides additional information related to the aerosol particle size (larger the value, the smaller the particle size). Values < 1 suggest optical dominance of coarse particles (e.g. dust) and values > 1 suggest optical dominance of fine particles (e.g. smoke).

The angstrom parameter is calculated for all available wavelengths within the Angstrom parameter range. For example, the Angstrom 870-440nm includes the 870, 670, 500 and 440 nm AOD data. A special case for a polarized instrument is Angstrom 870-440nm which only includes 870, 670 and 440 nm AOD data (polarized instruments do not have 500nm channel). Level 1.5 is automatically cloud cleared but may not have final calibration applied. These data are NOT quality assured.

Each AERONET ground-based remote sensing aerosol network site consist of a sun photometer and satellite transmission system. Sun photometer measurements of the direct (collimated) solar radiation provide information to calculate the columnar aerosol optical depth (AOD). AOD can be used to compute columnar water vapor (Precipitable Water) and estimate the aerosol size using the Angstrom parameter relationship.

The Daily layer displays the daily average based on the UTC solar day, ranging from < 0.0 to >= 2.5. Inactive sites are denoted in grey. Data for this layer is provided by the The AErosol RObotic NETwork ([AERONET](https://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov/)) program.
