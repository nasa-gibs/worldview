These images are called true-color or natural color because this combination of wavelengths is similar to what the human eye would see. The images are natural-looking images of land surface, oceanic and atmospheric features.

This Corrected Reflectance (True Color) layer is from the Spectro-Polarimeter for Planetary Exploration (SPEXone) instrument, which is a multi-angle polarimeter aboard NASA's Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, ocean Ecosystem (PACE) satellite. The sensor resolution is 5.4 x 4.6 km<sup>2</sup>, imagery resolution is 1 km, and the temporal resolution is daily.
