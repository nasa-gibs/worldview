The Surface Reflectance (NBAR, True Color, Global, Monthly, Version 3.0) layer is a true color composite of images from the Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) satellite and Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) satellite produced by the Web-Enabled Landsat Data (WELD) project. The layer is created from Landsat Band 3, 2, 1 Nadir BRDF (Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function) Adjusted Reflectance (NBAR). Version 3 includes atmospheric correction of the reflectance wavelength bands to surface reflectance, normalization of the surface reflectance to nadir view (0 degree view zenith) and a modeled solar zenith angle, and uses an improved  compositing algorithm for retrieving the single best Landsat observation at each pixel location is selected.

These images are called true color or natural color because the combination of wavelengths is similar to what the human eye would see. These are natural looking images of land surface, oceanic and atmospheric features.

The sensor resolution is 30 m, the imagery resolution is 31.25 m and the temporal availability is monthly for December 2008 - November 2011.
