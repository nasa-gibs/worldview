The Top of Atmosphere (TOA) Reflectance (True Color, Conterminous USA (CONUS), Monthly, Version 1.5) layer is a true color composite of images from the Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) satellite and Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) satellite produced by the Web-Enabled Landsat Data (WELD) project. The layer is created from Landsat Band 3, 2, 1 TOA reflectance. These images are called true color or natural color because the combination of wavelengths is similar to what the human eye would see. These are natural looking images of land surface, oceanic and atmospheric features.

The sensor resolution is 30 m, the imagery resolution is 250 m and the temporal availability is monthly for December 2002 - November 2012.
