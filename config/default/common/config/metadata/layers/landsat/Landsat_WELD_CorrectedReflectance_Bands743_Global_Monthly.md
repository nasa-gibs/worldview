The Surface Reflectance (Bands 7-4-3, Global, Monthly, V3.1) layer is a color composite of images from all available Landsat 4 and 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) and Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) Collection 1 data and is produced by the Global Web Enabled Landsat Data (GWELD) project. The layer is created from Landsat Band 7, 4, 3 surface reflectance. This combination provides a false color image focusing on burn scars while accounting for atmospheric effects such as atmospheric particles and smoke.

#### Vegetation and bare ground
Even the smallest hint of vegetation will appear bright green in the image. Naturally bare soil, like a desert, is reflective in all bands used in this image and will often have a pinkish tinge.

#### Burned areas
If vegetation burns, bare soil in the area will become exposed. Burn scars appear as deep or bright red, depending on the type of vegetation burned, the amount of residue, or the completeness of the burn.

#### Water
Water will appear black. Sediments in water appear dark blue.

The sensor resolution is 30 m with an imagery resolution is 31.25 m. The temporal availability is monthly for December 1988 - November 2001.
