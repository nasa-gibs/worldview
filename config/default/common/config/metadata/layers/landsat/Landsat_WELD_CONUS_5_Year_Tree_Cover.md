The 5 Year Tree Cover (Conterminous USA, Version 1.5) layer represents tree canopy cover estimated over five annual growing seasons. This layer is part of the the Web-Enabled Landsat Data (WELD) 5-year Land Cover Land Use Change (LCLUC) product. It is a composite of 30 m land use land change product for the contiguous United States (CONUS) generated from 5 years of consecutive growing season WELD inputs from 15 April 2006 to 17 November 2010. WELD data are created using Landsat Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) Terrain Corrected data.

This layer's sensor resolution is 30 m, imagery resolution is 31.25 m and is available as a 5 year (15 April 2006 - 17 November 2010) composite.
