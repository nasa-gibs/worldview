### Surface Reflectance (NBAR, True Color, Global, Annual | Monthly, V3.1)
Temporal coverage: Annual: 1998 - 2001; Monthly: December 1998 - November 2001

The Surface Reflectance (NBAR, True Color, Global, Version 3.1) Annual and Monthly layers are a true color composite of images from all available Landsat 4 and 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) and Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) Collection 1 data and is produced by the Global Web Enabled Landsat Data (GWELD) project. The layer is created from Landsat Band 3, 2, 1 Nadir BRDF (Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function) Adjusted Reflectance (NBAR). Version 3 includes atmospheric correction of the reflectance wavelength bands to surface reflectance, normalization of the surface reflectance to nadir view (0 degree view zenith) and a modeled solar zenith angle, and uses an improved compositing algorithm for retrieving the single best Landsat observation at each pixel location is selected.

These images are called true color or natural color because the combination of wavelengths is similar to what the human eye would see. These are natural looking images of land surface, oceanic and atmospheric features.

The sensor resolution is 30 m with an imagery resolution is 31.25 m. The temporal availability for the annual layer is 1998 - 2001 and December 1998 - November 2001 for the monthly layer.

### Surface Reflectance (Bands 1-5-7, Global, Annual | Monthly, V3.1)
Temporal coverage: Annual: 1998 - 2001; Monthly: December 1998 - November 2001

The Surface Reflectance (Bands 1-5-7, Global, Annual | Monthly, V3.1) layers are a color composite of images from all available Landsat 4 and 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) and Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) Collection 1 data and is produced by the Global Web Enabled Landsat Data (GWELD) project. The layers are created from Landsat Band 1, 5, 7 surface reflectance. This combination provides a false color image focusing on snow and ice.

#### Snow and Ice
Snow and ice appear bright red. Thick ice and snow appear vivid red (or red-orange), while small ice crystals in high-level clouds will appear reddish-orange or peach.

#### Vegetation
Vegetation will appear greenish in this band combination. Bare soil will appear bright cyan.

#### Water
Liquid water on the ground will be very dark, but small liquid water drops in clouds will appear white. Sediments in water appear dark red.

The sensor resolution is 30 m with an imagery resolution is 31.25 m. The temporal availability for the annual layer is 1989 - 2001, and December 1988 - November 2001 for the monthly layer.

### Surface Reflectance (Bands 7-4-3, Global, Annual | Monthly, V3.1)
Temporal coverage: Annual: 1998 - 2001; Monthly: December 1998 - November 2001

The Surface Reflectance (Bands 7-4-3, Global, Annual | Monthly, V3.1) layers are a color composite of images from all available Landsat 4 and 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) and Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) Collection 1 data and is produced by the Global Web Enabled Landsat Data (GWELD) project. The layers are created from Landsat Band 7, 4, 3 surface reflectance. This combination provides a false color image focusing on burn scars while accounting for atmospheric effects such as atmospheric particles and smoke.

#### Vegetation and bare ground
Even the smallest hint of vegetation will appear bright green in the image. Naturally bare soil, like a desert, is reflective in all bands used in this image and will often have a pinkish tinge.

#### Burned areas
If vegetation burns, bare soil in the area will become exposed. Burn scars appear as deep or bright red, depending on the type of vegetation burned, the amount of residue, or the completeness of the burn.

#### Water
Water will appear black. Sediments in water appear dark blue.

The sensor resolution is 30 m with an imagery resolution is 31.25 m. The temporal availability for the annual layer is 1989 - 2001, and December 1988 - November 2001 for the monthly layer.
