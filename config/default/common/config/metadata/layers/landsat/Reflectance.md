### Surface Reflectance (NBAR, True Color, Global, Annual | Monthly, V3.1)
Temporal coverage: Annual: 1989 - 2001; Monthly: December 1988 - November 2001

The Surface Reflectance (NBAR, True Color, Global, Version 3.1) Annual and Monthly layers are a true color composite of images from all available Landsat 4 and 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) and Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) Collection 1 data and is produced by the Global Web Enabled Landsat Data (GWELD) project. The layer is created from Landsat Band 3, 2, 1 Nadir BRDF (Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function) Adjusted Reflectance (NBAR). Version 3 includes atmospheric correction of the reflectance wavelength bands to surface reflectance, normalization of the surface reflectance to nadir view (0 degree view zenith) and a modeled solar zenith angle, and uses an improved compositing algorithm for retrieving the single best Landsat observation at each pixel location is selected.

These images are called true color or natural color because the combination of wavelengths is similar to what the human eye would see. These are natural looking images of land surface, oceanic and atmospheric features.

The sensor resolution is 30 m with an imagery resolution is 31.25 m. The temporal availability for the annual layer is 1989 - 2001 and December 1988 - November 2001 for the monthly layer.
