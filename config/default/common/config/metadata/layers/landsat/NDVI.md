### Surface Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) (NBAR, Global, Annual | Monthly, V3.1)
Temporal coverage: Annual: 1998 - 2001; Monthly: December 1998 - November 2001

The Surface Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) (NBAR, Global, Version 3.1) Annual and Monthly layers are a composite of images from all available Landsat 4 and 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) and Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) Collection 1 data and is produced by the Global Web Enabled Landsat Data (GWELD) project. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index is a measure of the greenness and health of vegetation. The index is calculated based on how much red and near-infrared light is reflected by plant leaves. The layer is created from Landsat Bands 3 and 4 Nadir BRDF (Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function) Adjusted Reflectance (NBAR). Areas with a lot of green leaf growth, indicates the presence of chlorophyll which reflects more infrared light and less visible light, are depicted in dark green colors, areas with some green leaf growth are in light greens, and areas with little to no vegetation growth are depicted in tan colors.

The sensor resolution is 30 m with an imagery resolution is 31.25 m. The temporal availability for the annual layer is 1998 - 2001 and December 1998 - November 2001 for the monthly layer.
