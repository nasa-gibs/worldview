The Top of Atmosphere (TOA) Reflectance (True Color, Alaska, Annual Version 1.5) layer is a true color composite of images from the Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) satellite and Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) satellite produced by the Web-Enabled Landsat Data (WELD) project. The layer is created from Landsat Band 3, 2, 1 TOA reflectance. These images are called true color or natural color because the combination of wavelengths is similar to what the human eye would see. These are natural looking images of land surface, oceanic and atmospheric features.

The sensor resolution is 30 m, the imagery resolution is 250 m and the temporal availability is annual for 2002 - 2011 where the annual composite is from the preceding year’s December through the current year’s November. For example, for the year 2007, the product includes data from December 1, 2006 through November 30, 2007.
