### About Water Vapor
Almost all of atmospheric moisture is in the form of water vapor. This water vapor drives the development of weather systems on short time scales and influences the climate on longer time scales. Water vapor is Earthâ€™s primary greenhouse gas and traps more heat than carbon dioxide. The movement of water vapor around the globe helps determine the amount of precipitation a region might receive and helps transport heat from the tropics to the poles.

### About OCO-3
The Orbiting Carbon Observatory-3 (OCO-3) was deployed to the International Space Station in May, 2019. It is technically a single instrument, almost identical to OCO-2.

The Orbiting Carbon Observatory is the first NASA mission designed to collect space-based measurements of atmospheric carbon dioxide with the precision, resolution, and coverage needed to characterize the processes controlling its buildup in the atmosphere.

OCO-3 incorporates three high-resolution spectrometers that make coincident measurements of reflected sunlight in the near-infrared CO<sub>2</sub> near 1.61 and 2.06 micrometers and in molecular oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) A-Band at 0.76 micrometers. The three spectrometers have different characteristics and are calibrated independently.
