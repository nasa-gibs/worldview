### Soil Moisture (UCAR, SDR, Daily)
Temporal coverage: 18 March 2017 - present

The CYGNSS/DDMI Level 3 Soil Moisture (UCAR, SDR, Daily) layer provides volumetric water content estimates for soils between 0-5 cm depth in units of cm<sup>3</sup>/cm<sup>3</sup> for most of the subtropics. The data were produced by CYGNSS investigators at the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR) and the University Colorado at Boulder (CU), and derive from version 2.1 of the CYGNSS L1 SDR. The soil moisture algorithm uses collocated soil moisture retrievals from SMAP to calibrate CYGNSS observations from the same day. For a given location, a linear relationship between the SMAP soil moisture and CYGNSS reflectivity is determined and used to transform the CYGNSS observations into soil moisture. The spatial resolution is 36km and temporal resolution is daily.
