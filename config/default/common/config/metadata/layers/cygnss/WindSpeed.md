### Wind Speed (Daily)
Temporal coverage: 1 August 2018 - present

 The CYGNSS/DDMI Wind Speed (Daily) layer is the Daily ocean surface wind speed (meters per second) as provided by the Delay Doppler Mapping Instrument (DDMI) on board the CYGNSS spacecraft constellation. It is from the Version 3.0 CYGNSS Level 3 Science Data Record which provides the average wind speed and mean square slope (MSS) on a 0.2x0.2 degree latitude by longitude equirectangular grid obtained from the Delay Doppler Mapping Instrument aboard the CYGNSS satellite constellation. The Level 2 Delay Doppler Map (DDM) data are used in the direct processing of the average wind speed and MSS data that are binned on the Level 3 grid. A subset of DDM data used in the direct processing of the average wind speed and MSS is co-located inside of the Level 2 data files. The reported sample locations are determined by the specular points corresponding to the Delay Doppler Maps (DDMs). The Version 3.0 release inherits all improvements made to the version 3.0 Level 2 data intended to improve the quality of the wind speed retrievals.

 TThe layer provides high resolution wind speed data that allows for global tropical ocean observation.  he primary mission objective for CYGNSS is to provide frequent space‐based measurements of ocean surface wind speed in the inner core of tropical cyclones. The orbital asynchronicity with respect to the local solar daytime/nightime patterns may provide additional scientific opportunity to study wind speed variations and patterns due to the diurnal cycle.

 The CYGNSS constellation includes 8 spacecraft observatories, in which one day will nominally contain data from 6 out of 8 CYGNSS observatories. Data latency ranges from 24 hours to 6 days from the last available observation. Daily coverage is constrained to the global tropical oceans and basins within the 40 degree north and south latitude band.

### Wind Speed (Daily)
Temporal coverage: 18 March 2017 - present

The CYGNSS/DDMI Ocean Surface Wind Speed (L3, 0.2x0.2 Degree Grid, Daily) layer is the Daily ocean surface wind speed (meters per second) as provided by the Delay Doppler Mapping Instrument (DDMI) on board the CYGNSS spacecraft constellation. The layer provides high resolution wind speed data that allows for global tropical ocean observation. The primary mission objective for CYGNSS is to provide frequent space‐based measurements of ocean surface wind speed in the inner core of tropical cyclones. The orbital asynchronicity with respect to the local solar daytime/nightime patterns may provide additional scientific opportunity to study wind speed variations and patterns due to the diurnal cycle. The data imagery is provided by the CYGNSS Version 1.0 CYGNSS Level 3 Climate Data Record (CDR). The Version 1.0 CDR represents the first climate-quality release and is a collection of reanalysis products derived from the Science Data Record v2.1 Level 1 data.

The CYGNSS constellation includes 8 spacecraft observatories, in which one day will nominally contain data from 6 out of 8 CYGNSS observatories. Data latency ranges from 24 hours to 6 days from the last available observation. Daily coverage is constrained to the global tropical oceans and basins within the 40 degree north and south latitude band.
