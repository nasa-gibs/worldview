### TOA Longwave | Shortwave | Window-Region Flux (Monthly, All-Sky | Clear-Sky)
Temporal Coverage: March 2000 - June 2002

The CERES TOA Longwave | Shortwave | Window-Region Flux (Monthly, All-Sky | Clear-Sky) layers show CERES-observed temporally interpolated and spatially gridded top-of-atmosphere (TOA) outgoing observed flux or radiance (W/m<sup>2</sup>) contained within the SYN1deg product, which is a primary input to the EBAF product. These layers are for the longwave broadband channel (3.5-50 µm), shortwave broadband channel (0.2-5 µm) and atmospheric thermal window-region (8-12 µm), under either all-sky conditions or clear-sky conditions. CERES footprints (20 km nominal resolution) are classified as clear if they contain 99% of pixels identified as clear by the CERES-MODIS clear-sky mask.

The Clouds and the Earth’s Radiant Energy System (CERES) instruments are a collection of instruments carried on different satellites, the first launched in 1999 (Terra) as a follow-on to the successful Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) mission, and as a flagship component of the Earth Observing System (EOS) program. The second satellite (Aqua) was launched in 2002. There are two identical CERES instruments aboard both the Terra and Aqua satellites, that measure the Earth's total radiation budget and provide cloud property estimates that enable scientists to assess clouds' roles in radiative fluxes from the surface to the top of the atmosphere. One of the instruments operates in a cross-track scan mode and the other in a biaxial scan mode. The cross-track mode data is what is used to align the CERES measurements with ERBE and the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM), essentially extending the data record.

The CERES TOA Longwave | Shortwave | Window-Region Flux (Monthly, All-Sky | Clear-Sky) layers are available from the CERES instruments on the Terra satellite. The sensor resolution is 1 degree, imagery resolution is 2 km, and the temporal resolution is monthly.

### TOA Longwave | Shortwave | Net Flux (Monthly, Energy Balanced and Filled, All-Sky | Clear-Sky)
Temporal Coverage: March 2000 - December 2016

The TOA Longwave | Shortwave | Net Flux (Monthly, Energy Balanced and Filled, All-Sky | Clear-Sky) layers are the Top of the Atmosphere (TOA, which CERES defines as the effective Earth-atmosphere disc found at 20 km altitude that captures the Sun's energy) outgoing radiance corresponding to longwave (3.5-50 µm), shortwave (0.2-5 µm) broadband channel, and net  for either all-sky or clear-sky conditions. CERES footprints (20 km nominal resolution) are classified as clear if they contain 99% of pixels identified as clear by the CERES-MODIS clear-sky mask.

The TOA Net TOA Flux represents the broadband incoming solar (downwelling incident sunlight) minus the reflected shortwave (SW) and emitted longwave (LW) flux at TOA (both upwelling, defined as positive), for all-sky conditions. It can be thought of the balance between incoming and outgoing energy, indicating the total energy that is available to influence the climate. A positive global Net Flux over time indicates the Earth is warming, whereas negative values indicate cooling.

The CERES Energy Balanced and Filled (EBAF) layers are derived from CERES SYN1Deg products, and provide monthly mean radiative fluxes corresponding to collection either at the Earth’s surface (EBAF-Surface) or top-of-the-atmosphere (EBAF-TOA). EBAF-products were designed for climate model evaluation, estimating the Earth's global mean energy budget, and to infer meridional heat transport. For some climate modelers, the products address the need for a net imbalance constrained to the ocean heat storage term.

For EBAF surface fluxes, all-sky and clear-sky fluxes are calculated at all hourly increments during the month, regardless of cloud amount. For the all-sky condition, corresponding cloud type is specified for each pixel (e.g. ITCZ, maritime stratus, etc.). In regions with frequent cloudiness, it is possible that no clear-sky observations exist over a given month. Whereas the SSF1deg product, from which this product originates, does not attempt to fill in these non-measured clear-sky regions and default values are placed where there are no CERES observed clear-sky footprints in the spatial or temporal domain, the EBAF clear-sky filled product is a spatially complete clear-sky product.

### TOA CRE Longwave | Shortwave | Net Flux (Monthly, Energy Balanced and Filled)
Temporal Coverage: March 2000 - December 2016

The TOA CRE Longwave | Shortwave | Net Flux (Monthly, Energy Balanced and Filled) layer show Top of the Atmosphere (TOA, which CERES defines as the effective Earth-atmosphere disc found at 20 km altitude that captures the Sun's energy) outgoing radiance corresponding to the longwave (3.5-50 µm) broadband channel, shortwave (0.2-5 µm) broadband channel, for the Cloud Radiative Effects (CRE) or cloud forcing (which is the difference above the cloud layer, between the all-sky and clear sky conditions). CERES footprints (20 km nominal resolution) are classified as clear if they contain 99% of pixels identified as clear by the CERES-MODIS clear-sky mask.

The Net TOA Flux represents the broadband incoming solar (downwelling incident sunlight) minus the reflected shortwave (SW) and emitted longwave (LW) flux at TOA (both upwelling, defined as positive).

### Incoming Solar Flux (Monthly, Energy Balanced and Filled)
Temporal Coverage: March 2000 - December 2016

The Incoming Solar Flux (Monthly, Energy Balanced and Filled) layer shows the downwelling broadband shortwave radiant energy from the sun (irradiance), transferred across a unit area in unit time (W/m<sup>-2</sup>), at the top of the atmosphere (TOA - 20 km altitude). More simply, it is the incident sunlight to Earth’s atmosphere (defined as positive). The CERES EBAF Edition 2 and 3 products use solar irradiance calculated using daily measurements provided by the [Solar Radiation and Climate Experiment (SORCE) observatory](http://lasp.colorado.edu/sorce/data/tsi_data.htm). These daily measurements are intended to reflect natural variability of the sun and account for the 11-year (sunspot) solar cycle. A mean solar constant of 1361 W/m<sup>-2</sup> is used, which differs from other CERES Edition2 and ERBE products.

The CERES Energy Balanced and Filled (EBAF) layers are derived from CERES SYN1Deg products, and provide monthly mean radiative fluxes corresponding to collection either at the Earth’s surface (EBAF-Surface) or top-of-the-atmosphere (EBAF-TOA). EBAF-products were designed for climate model evaluation, estimating the Earth's global mean energy budget, and to infer meridional heat transport.
