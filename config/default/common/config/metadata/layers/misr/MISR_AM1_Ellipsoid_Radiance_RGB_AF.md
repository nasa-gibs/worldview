The MISR Color Radiance layer displays the daily radiance data captured by MISR’s Af (26.1-degree forward-pointing) camera in the red, green, and blue bands created with near real-time (NRT) processing. Radiance is a measure of the energy emitted and/or reflected by the Earth’s surface in a particular direction, per unit area, per wavelength. MISR’s radiances are reported in units of W m<sup>-2</sup> sr<sup>-1</sup> µm<sup>-1</sup>. MISR radiances are used to create natural-color images. Along with the measurements from MISR’s near-infrared band, these radiances are the base measurements from which all other MISR data products are produced.

This layer is produced from the Red Radiance/RDQI, Green Radiance/RDQI, and Blue Radiance/RDQI fields of the MISR Level 1 Near Real Time Georectified Ellipsoid Radiance Product. It is available globally over both land and ocean on a daily basis, with a resolution of 250 meters per pixel. The images become available approximately three hours after they are captured by the MISR instrument. The images are processed in 10-50 minute portions of the complete MISR orbit.
