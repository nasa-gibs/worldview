The MISR Color Radiance layer displays the daily radiance data captured by MISR’s Da (70.5-degree aftward-pointing) camera in the near-infrared, green, and blue bands created with near real-time (NRT) processing. Radiance is a measure of the energy emitted and/or reflected by the Earth’s surface in a particular direction, per unit area, per wavelength. MISR’s radiances are reported in units of W m<sup>-2</sup> sr<sup>-1</sup> µm<sup>-1</sup>. These three MISR radiances are used to create false-color images that highlight the presence of vegetation and surface water. Along with the measurements from MISR’s red band, these radiances are the base measurements from which all other MISR data products are produced.

This layer is produced from the NIR Radiance/RDQI, Green Radiance/RDQI, and Blue Radiance/RDQI fields of the MISR Level 1 Near Real Time Georectified Ellipsoid Radiance Product. It is available globally over both land and ocean on a daily basis, on a rolling 6-month window, with a spatial resolution of 1 km per pixel. The images become available approximately three hours after they are captured by the MISR instrument. The images are processed in 10-50 minute portions of the complete MISR orbit.
