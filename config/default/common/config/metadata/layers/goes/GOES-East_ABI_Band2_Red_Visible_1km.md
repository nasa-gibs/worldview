Note: This layer is generally available for the **most recent 90 days**, though certain historical ranges are also preserved.

The Red Visible (0.64 um, Band 2) layer from the GOES-East Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) is used primarily to monitor the evolution of clouds throughout the daylight hours. It is also useful for identifying small-scale features such as river fog/clear air boundaries, or overshooting tops of cumulus clouds. It can also be used to identify daytime snow and ice cover, diagnose low-level cloud-drift winds, assist with detections of volcanic ash and analysis of hurricanes and winter storms.

The Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES)-East satellite (currently, GOES-16) is centered on 75.2 degrees W, covering the Conterminous US, Canada, Central and South America. The GOES-East ABI imagery is available on a rolling 90 day basis at 10 minute intervals. The sensor resolution of Band 2 is 0.5 km, the imagery resolution in Worldview/Global Imagery Browse Services (GIBS) is 1 km and the temporal resolution is 10 minutes.
