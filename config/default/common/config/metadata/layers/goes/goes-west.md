### GeoColor (True Color (Day), Multispectral IR (Night))
Temporal coverage: Most recent month

The GeoColor (True Color (Day), Multispectral IR (Night)) layer from the GOES-West Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) provides a close approximation to daytime True Color imagery as possible from GOES-West. This band combination of wavelengths is somewhat similar to what the human eye would see and provides natural-looking imagery of land surface, oceanic and atmospheric features. It is used primarily for intuitive interpretation of meteorological and surface-based features such as smoke, blowing dust, and smog. At night, the true color imagery is replaced with an infrared- (IR) based multispectral product that provides differentiation between low liquid water clouds and higher ice clouds. It also includes a static city lights/night lights database derived from the VIIRS Day/Night Band which aids in geo-referencing and can help determine whether clouds (such as fog) are affecting populated regions.

The Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES)-West satellite (currently, GOES-17) is centered on 137.2 degrees W, covering most of the Pacific Ocean, the USA, most of Canada, Central, the western half of South America, parts of Australasia. The GOES-West ABI imagery is available on a rolling monthly basis at 10 minute intervals. The product resolution is 1.5 km, the imagery resolution in Worldview/Global Imagery Browse Services (GIBS) is 1 km and the temporal resolution is 10 minutes.

### Red Visible (0.64 µm, Band 2, 10 minute)
Temporal coverage: Most recent month

The Red Visible (0.64 um, Band 2) layer from the GOES-West Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) is used primarily to monitor the evolution of clouds throughout the daylight hours. It is also useful for identifying small-scale features such as river fog/clear air boundaries, or overshooting tops of cumulus clouds. It can also be used to identify daytime snow and ice cover, diagnose low-level cloud-drift winds, assist with detections of volcanic ash and analysis of hurricanes and winter storms.

The GOES-West ABI imagery is available on a rolling monthly basis at 10 minute intervals. The sensor resolution of Band 2 is 0.5 km, the imagery resolution in Worldview/Global Imagery Browse Services (GIBS) is 1 km and the temporal resolution is 10 minutes.

### Clean Infrared (10.3 µm, Band 13, 10 minute)
Temporal coverage: Most recent month

The Clean Infrared (10.3 um, Band 13) layer from the GOES-West Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) is useful for detecting clouds all times of day and night and is quite useful in retrievals of cloud top height. It is used to identify and classify cloud and other atmospheric features, estimate cloud-top brightness temperature and cloud particle size, convective severe weather signatures, and hurricane intensity. This infrared window is not strongly affected by atmospheric water vapor.

The GOES-West ABI imagery is available on a rolling monthly basis at 10 minute intervals. The sensor resolution of Band 13 is 2 km, the imagery resolution in Worldview/Global Imagery Browse Services (GIBS) is 2 km and the temporal resolution is 10 minutes.

### Air Mass (10 minute)
Temporal coverage: Most recent month

The Air Mass layer from the GOES-West Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) is used primarily for distinguishing between polar and tropical air masses, especially along frontal boundaries and identify high, mid, and low-level clouds. It can also be used to infer cyclogenesis by identifying warm, dry, ozone-rich descending stratospheric air associated with jet streams and potential vorticity (PV) anomalies. The RGB image is comprised of Bands 6.2-7.3, 9.6-10.4 and 6.2.
