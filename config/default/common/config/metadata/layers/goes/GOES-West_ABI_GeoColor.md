The GeoColor (True Color (Day), Multispectral IR (Night)) layer from the GOES-West Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) provides a close approximation to daytime True Color imagery as possible from GOES-West. This band combination of wavelengths is somewhat similar to what the human eye would see and provides natural-looking imagery of land surface, oceanic and atmospheric features. It is used primarily for intuitive interpretation of meteorological and surface-based features such as smoke, blowing dust, and smog. At night, the true color imagery is replaced with an infrared- (IR) based multispectral product that provides differentiation between low liquid water clouds and higher ice clouds. It also includes a static city lights/night lights database derived from the VIIRS Day/Night Band which aids in geo-referencing and can help determine whether clouds (such as fog) are affecting populated regions.

The Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES)-West satellite (currently, GOES-17) is centered on 137.2 degrees W, covering most of the Pacific Ocean, the USA, most of Canada, Central, the western half of South America, parts of Australasia. The GOES-West ABI imagery is available on a rolling monthly basis at 10 minute intervals. The product resolution is 1.5 km, the imagery resolution in Worldview/Global Imagery Browse Services (GIBS) is 1 km and the temporal resolution is 10 minutes.
