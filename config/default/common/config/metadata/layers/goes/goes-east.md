### GeoColor (True Color (Day), Multispectral IR (Night))
Temporal coverage: Last 90 days (Generally available for the **most recent 90 days**, though certain historical ranges are also preserved.)

The GeoColor (True Color (Day), Multispectral blended infrared (IR; at Night)) layer from the GOES-East Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) provides an approximation to daytime True Color imagery. The combination of spectral bands yields an appearance similar to what the human eye would perceive for land surface, oceanic and atmospheric features, with atmospheric correction used to make the appearance of these features sharper. Thus it is used primarily for the intuitive interpretation of meteorological and surface-based features such as smoke, blowing dust, and vegetation types (forests, deserts, croplands, etc.). At night, the true color imagery gives way to IR-based blended multispectral imagery that provides differentiation between low liquid water clouds (shown in light-blue) and higher ice clouds (shown in gray/white). It also includes a static city lights/night lights database derived from the VIIRS Day/Night Band, which aids in geo-referencing and can help determine the proximity of clouds (such as fog) or weather hazards (such as thunderstorms or tropical cyclones) to population centers. Please note that as these lights are static, they will not change even if, for example, a weather-induced power outage occurs.

The Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES)-East satellite (currently, GOES-16) is centered on 75.2 degrees W, covering the Conterminous US, Canada, Central and South America. The GOES-East ABI imagery is available on a rolling monthly basis at 10 minute intervals. The product resolution is 1 km, the imagery resolution in Worldview/Global Imagery Browse Services (GIBS) is 1 km and the temporal resolution is 10 minutes.

### Red Visible (0.64 µm, Band 2, 10 minute)
Temporal coverage: Last 30 days (Generally available for the **most recent 30 days**, though certain historical ranges are also preserved.)

The Red Visible (0.64 um, Band 2) layer from the GOES-East Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) is used primarily to monitor the evolution of clouds throughout the daylight hours. It is also useful for identifying small-scale features such as river fog/clear air boundaries, or overshooting tops of cumulus clouds. It can also be used to identify daytime snow and ice cover, diagnose low-level cloud-drift winds, assist with detections of volcanic ash and analysis of hurricanes and winter storms.

The sensor resolution of Band 2 is 0.5 km, the imagery resolution in Worldview/Global Imagery Browse Services (GIBS) is 1 km and the temporal resolution is 10 minutes.

### Clean Infrared (10.3 µm, Band 13, 10 minute)
Temporal coverage: Last 30 days (Generally available for the **most recent 30 days**, though certain historical ranges are also preserved.)

The Clean Infrared (10.3 um, Band 13) layer from the GOES-East Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) is useful for detecting clouds all times of day and night and is quite useful in retrievals of cloud top height. It is used to identify and classify cloud and other atmospheric features, estimate cloud-top brightness temperature and cloud particle size, convective severe weather signatures, and hurricane intensity. This infrared window is not strongly affected by atmospheric water vapor.

The sensor resolution of Band 13 is 2 km, the imagery resolution in Worldview/Global Imagery Browse Services (GIBS) is 2 km and the temporal resolution is 10 minutes.

### Air Mass (10 minute)
Temporal coverage: Last 30 days (Generally available for the **most recent 30 days**, though certain historical ranges are also preserved.)

The Air Mass layer from the GOES-East Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) is used primarily for distinguishing between polar and tropical air masses, especially along frontal boundaries and identify high, mid, and low-level clouds. It can also be used to infer cyclogenesis by identifying warm, dry, ozone-rich descending stratospheric air associated with jet streams and potential vorticity (PV) anomalies. The RGB image is comprised of Bands 6.2-7.3, 9.6-10.4 and 6.2.
