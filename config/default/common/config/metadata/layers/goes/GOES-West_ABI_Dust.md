Note: This layer is generally available for the **most recent 90 days**, though certain historical ranges are also preserved.

The Dust RGB layer from the GOES-West Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) is used to identify dust. Dust can be hard to see in visible and infrared imagery because it is optically thin, or because it appears similar to other cloud types such as cirrus. The Dust RGB layer contrasts airborne dust from clouds using band differencing and the IR thermal channel. The IR band differencing allows dust storms to be observed during both daytime and at night.

To interpret the RGB image, the following is a guide as to what each color represents in the image:

* Dust plume, day - bright magenta, pink, Note: Dust at night becomes purple shades below 3 km
* Low, water cloud - light purple
* Desert surface, day - light blue
* Mid, thick clouds - tan shades
* Mid, thin cloud - green
* Cold, thick clouds - red
* High, thin ice clouds - black
* Very thin clouds, over warm surface - blue

The Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES)-West satellite (currently, GOES-18) is centered on 137.2 degrees W, covering most of the Pacific Ocean, the USA, most of Canada, Central America, the western half of South America, and parts of Australasia. The GOES-West ABI imagery is available on a rolling 90-day basis at 10 minute intervals. The sensor resolution is 2 km, the imagery resolution in Worldview/Global Imagery Browse Services (GIBS) is 2 km, the temporal resolution is 10 minutes, and the latency (time from satellite acquisition to availability in GIBS) is approximately 40 minutes.
