These images are called true-color or natural color because this combination of wavelengths is similar to what the human eye would see. The images are natural-looking images of land surface, oceanic and atmospheric features.

This Corrected Reflectance (True Color) layer is from the Hyper-Angular Rainbow Polarimeter #2 (HARP2) instrument, which is a wide-angle imaging polarimeter aboard NASA's Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, ocean Ecosystem (PACE) satellite. The sensor resolution is 2.6 km, imagery resolution is 1 km, and the temporal resolution is daily.
