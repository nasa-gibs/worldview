The Protected Areas layer is the World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA) polygon layer containing information on protected areas around the world. It is the most comprehensive global database of marine and terrestrial protected areas and is one of the key global biodiversity datasets being widely used by scientists, businesses, governments, International secretariats and others to inform planning, policy decisions and management.

The WDPA is a joint project between UN Environment and the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). The compilation and management of the WDPA is carried out by UN Environment World Conservation Monitoring Centre (UNEP-WCMC), in collaboration with governments, non-governmental organisations, academia and industry. There are monthly updates of the data which are made available online through the [Protected Planet website](http://www.protectedplanet.net/) where the data is both viewable and downloadable.
