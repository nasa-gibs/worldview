The OMI Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) Planetary Boundary Layer (PBL) is one of the parameters contained in the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) Level-3 SO2 (OMSO2e) product. The parameter measures the tropospheric boundary-layer component of the total SO2 column measured in Dobson Units (DU).

Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) is one of the US Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) six major regulated criteria pollutants (Tropospheric Ozone, Nitrogen Dioxide, Sulfur Dioxide, Lead, PM2.5 and PM 10 particulates). It irritates the eyes, nose, and lungs. High concentrations of SO2 can result in temporary breathing impairment. It is produced by combustion of coal, fuel oil, and gasoline, since these fuels contain sulfur in the combustion, and in the oxidation of naturally occurring sulfur gases. It is a precursor to sulfuric acid, which is a major constituent of acid rain. SO2 is injected into the stratosphere by volcanic eruptions. SO2 also is a major precursor to PM2.5, which is a significant health concern, and a main contributor to poor visibility.

The OMSO2e product provides daily gridded global coverage with a temporal resolution of 1 day, imagery resolution of 2 km, and sensor/algorithm resolution of 0.25 x 0.25 degrees.
