The OMI Cloud Pressure layer indicates the effective cloud pressure (in fact, a cloud scattering layer mean pressure), and is measured in hectopascals (hPa). The retrieved cloud cover and pressure are used to estimate, and correct for, the amount of trace gas hidden below the clouds.

The Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) instrument on board the Aura satellite. The OMI Cloud Pressure layer is a science parameter of the OMI Cloud Pressure and Fraction using O₂-O₂ absorption (OMCLDO2) dataset. The sensor resolution is 25 km, imagery resolution is 2 km, and the temporal resolution is daily.
