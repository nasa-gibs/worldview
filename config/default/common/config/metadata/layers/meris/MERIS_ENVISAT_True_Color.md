These images are called true-color or natural color because this combination of wavelengths is similar to what the human eye would see. The images are natural-looking images of land surface, oceanic and atmospheric features. The downside of this set of bands is that they tend to produce a hazy image.

The MERIS True Color Corrected Reflectance product was available from the ENVISAT satellite. The sensor resolution was 1.2 km and imagery resolution was 1 km, and the temporal resolution was daily.

MERIS (Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer) was a programmable, medium-spectral resolution, imaging spectrometer operating in the solar reflective spectral range aboard the ENVISAT satellite. It was operational from 2002 to 2012.
