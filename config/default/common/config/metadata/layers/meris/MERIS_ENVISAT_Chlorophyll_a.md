The Chlorophyll *a* layer provides the near-surface concentration of chlorophyll *a* in milligrams of chlorophyll pigment per cubic meter (mg/m<sup>3</sup>) in the ocean.

The MERIS Chlorophyll *a* product was available from the ENVISAT satellite. The sensor resolution was 1.2 km and imagery resolution was 1 km, and the temporal resolution was daily.

MERIS (Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer) was a programmable, medium-spectral resolution, imaging spectrometer operating in the solar reflective spectral range aboard the ENVISAT satellite. It was operational from 2002 to 2012.
