### Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (NASA SRTM v3, Color Index)

The Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (NASA SRTM v3, Color Index) layer is from the the NASA Making Earth System Data Records for Use in Research Environments (MEaSUREs) Version 3 Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) data product (SRTMGL1). This layer provides near-global, void-free, elevation information at 1 arc second (~30 meter) spatial resolution between 60° north and 56° south latitude. NASA SRTM data products result from a collaborative effort by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), as well as the participation of the German and Italian space agencies. The purpose of the SRTM was to generate a digital elevation model (DEM) of 80% of the Earth's surface using radar interferometry. SRTM was a primary component of the payload on the Space Shuttle Endeavour during its STS-99 mission. Endeavour launched February 11, 2000 and ﬂew for 11 days. On the default palette, white indicates the highest elevations, then brown, yellow and greens indicate low elevations.
