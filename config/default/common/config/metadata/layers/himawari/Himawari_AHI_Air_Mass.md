The Air Mass layer from the Himawari-8 Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) is used primarily for distinguishing between polar and tropical air masses, especially along frontal boundaries and identify high, mid, and low-level clouds. It can also be used to infer cyclogenesis by identifying warm, dry, ozone-rich descending stratospheric air associated with jet streams and potential vorticity (PV) anomalies. The RGB image is comprised of Bands 6.2-7.3, 9.6-10.4 and 6.2.

The Himawari-8 satellite covers most of the Pacific Ocean, a portion of Eastern Asia, and parts of Australasia. The Himawari-8 AHI imagery is available only on a rolling 14 day basis. The sensor resolution is 2 km, the imagery resolution in Worldview/Global Imaging Browse Services (GIBS) is 2 km and the temporal resolution is 10 minutes.
