Note: This layer is generally available for the **most recent 30 days**, though certain historical ranges are also preserved.

The Red Visible (0.64 um, Band 3) layer from the Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) is used primarily to monitor the evolution of clouds throughout the daylight hours. It is also useful for identifying small-scale features such as river fog/clear air boundaries, or overshooting tops of cumulus clouds. It can also be used to identify daytime snow and ice cover, diagnose low-level cloud-drift winds, assist with detections of volcanic ash and analysis of hurricanes and winter storms.  

The Himawari-8 satellite is centered on 140.7 degrees E, covering most of the Pacific Ocean, a portion of Eastern Asia, and parts of Australasia. The Himawari-8 AHI imagery is available on a rolling monthly basis at 10 minute intervals. The sensor resolution is 0.5 km, the imagery resolution in Worldview/Global Imaging Browse Services (GIBS) is 1 km and the temporal resolution is 10 minutes.
