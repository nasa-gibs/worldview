Note: These layers are generally available for the **most recent 30 days**, though certain historical ranges are also preserved.

### Red Visible (0.64 um, Band 3, 10 minute)
Temporal coverage: Last 30 days

The Red Visible (0.64 um, Band 3) layer from the Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) is used primarily to monitor the evolution of clouds throughout the daylight hours. It is also useful for identifying small-scale features such as river fog/clear air boundaries, or overshooting tops of cumulus clouds. It can also be used to identify daytime snow and ice cover, diagnose low-level cloud-drift winds, assist with detections of volcanic ash and analysis of hurricanes and winter storms.

The Himawari-8 satellite is centered on 140.7 degrees E, covering most of the Pacific Ocean, a portion of Eastern Asia, and parts of Australasia. The Himawari-8 AHI imagery is available on a rolling monthly basis at 10 minute intervals. The sensor resolution is 0.5 km, the imagery resolution in Worldview/Global Imagery Browse Services (GIBS) is 1 km and the temporal resolution is 10 minutes.

### Clean Infrared (10.3 um, Band 13, 10 minute)
Temporal coverage: Last 30 days

The Clean Infrared (10.3 um, Band 13) layer from the Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) is useful for detecting clouds all times of day and night and is quite useful in retrievals of cloud top height. It is used to identify and classify cloud and other atmospheric features, estimate cloud-top brightness temperature and cloud particle size, convective severe weather signatures, and hurricane intensity. This infrared window is not strongly affected by atmospheric water vapor.

The Himawari-8 satellite is centered on 140.7 degrees E, covering most of the Pacific Ocean, a portion of Eastern Asia, and parts of Australasia. The Himawari-8 AHI imagery is available on a rolling monthly basis at 10 minute intervals. The sensor resolution is 2 km, the imagery resolution in Worldview/Global Imagery Browse Services (GIBS) is 2 km and the temporal resolution is 10 minutes.

### Air Mass (10 minute)
Temporal coverage: Last 30 days

The Air Mass layer from the Himawari-8 Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) is used primarily for distinguishing between polar and tropical air masses, especially along frontal boundaries and identify high, mid, and low-level clouds. It can also be used to infer cyclogenesis by identifying warm, dry, ozone-rich descending stratospheric air associated with jet streams and potential vorticity (PV) anomalies. The RGB image is comprised of Bands 6.2-7.3, 9.6-10.4 and 6.2.
