This NLDAS Precipitation Total parameter is one of the land-surface forcing fields included in the North America Land Data Assimilation System Phase 2 (NLDAS-2) primary forcing monthly 0.125 degree data product.  NLDAS-2 primary forcing Precipitation Total data are derived from a temporal disaggregation of a gauge-only CPC analysis of daily precipitation, performed directly on the NLDAS grid and includes an orographic adjustment based on the widely-applied PRISM climatology. The NLDAS monthly Precipitation Total data are generated through temporal accumulation of the hourly data. The data are in unit “kg/m<sup>2</sup>” which is equivalent to “mm”.  

The NLDAS-2 monthly Precipitation Total is a science variable that indicates the amount of the monthly total precipitation (Liquid precipitation + Frozen precipitation). The data can be used for supporting research and applications related to global water and energy cycle, drought and flood, climate variability, land surface assimilation, etc.

The NLDAS Precipitation Total data are in 1/8th-degree grid spacing and the imagery resolution is 2 km, and the temporal resolution is monthly with a latency about 4 days.
