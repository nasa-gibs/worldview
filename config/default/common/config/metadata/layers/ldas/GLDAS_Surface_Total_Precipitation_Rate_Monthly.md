This GLDAS Total Precipitation Rate parameter is one of the land-surface forcing fields included in the Global Land Data Assimilation System Version 2.1 (GLDAS-2.1) Noah Land Surface Model (LSM) monthly 1.0 degree data product. GLDAS-2.0 data use the Princeton Global Meteorological Forcing Dataset, which provides near-surface meteorological data for driving land surface models and other terrestrial modeling systems. The GLDAS monthly data are generated through temporal averaging of the 3-hourly data. The data are in unit “kg/m<sup>2</sup>/s” which is equivalent to “mm/s”.

The GLDAS Total Precipitation Rate is a science variable that indicates the intensity of the total precipitation (Rain Precipitation Rate + Snow Precipitation Rate). The data can be used for supporting research and applications related to global water and energy cycle, drought and flood, climate variability, land surface assimilation, etc.

The GLDAS Total Precipitation Rate data are in 1.0 degree resolution and the imagery resolution is 2 km, and the temporal resolution is monthly.
