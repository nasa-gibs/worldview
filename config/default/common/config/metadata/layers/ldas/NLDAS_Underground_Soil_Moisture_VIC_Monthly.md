This NLDAS Soil Moisture is one of the model assimilated fields from the North America Land Data Assimilation System Phase 2 (NLDAS-2) VIC-4.0.3 Land Surface Model (LSM). The NLDAS Soil Moisture monthly data are generated through temporal averaging of the hourly data. This NLDAS-2 VIC Soil Moisture parameter represents the 0 - 100 cm depth-averaged amount of water in unit “kg/m<sup>2</sup>” which is equivalent to “mm”.  

Soil Moisture is a science variable that controls the exchange of water and heat energy between the land surface and the atmosphere through evaporation and plant transpiration. As a result, soil moisture plays an important role in the development of weather patterns and the production of precipitation. The NLDAS Soil Moisture data can be used for supporting research and applications related to global water and energy cycle, drought and flood, climate variability, land surface assimilation, etc.

The NLDAS Soil Moisture data are in 1/8th-degree grid spacing and the imagery resolution is 2 km, and the temporal resolution is monthly with a latency about 4 days.
