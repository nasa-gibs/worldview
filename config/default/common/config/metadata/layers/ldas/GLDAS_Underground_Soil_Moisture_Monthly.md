This GLDAS Soil Moisture parameter is one of the model assimilated fields from the Global Land Data Assimilation System Version 2.1 (GLDAS-2.1) Noah Land Surface Model (LSM) monthly 0.25 degree data product. The GLDAS monthly data are generated through temporal averaging of the 3-hourly data. This GLDAS Noah Soil Moisture parameter represents the 0 - 10 cm depth-averaged amount of water in unit “kg/m<sup>2</sup>” which is equivalent to “mm”.

Soil Moisture is a science variable that controls the exchange of water and heat energy between the land surface and the atmosphere through evaporation and plant transpiration. As a result, soil moisture plays an important role in the development of weather patterns and the production of precipitation. The GLDAS Soil Moisture data can be used for supporting research and applications related to global water and energy cycle, drought and flood, climate variability, land surface assimilation, etc.

The GLDAS Soil Moisture data are in 0.25 degree resolution and the imagery resolution is 2 km, and the temporal resolution is monthly.
