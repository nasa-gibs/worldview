#### About Carbon Monoxide
Carbon Monoxide (CO) is a poisonous, odorless and colorless gas. CO is produced by incomplete combustion of fossil fuels and biomass burning. It is a strong greenhouse gas. It is one of the longest-lived, naturally occurring atmospheric carbon compounds. In the atmosphere, CO is produced when methane reacts with atmospheric hydroxyl (OH) in the troposphere. CO is a long-lived tracer that is valuable for diagnosing atmospheric transport and identifying the source of air masses. The MLS CO data help quantify long-range transport of pollution in the upper troposphere and the impact of upwelling from the troposphere and downwelling from the mesosphere on stratospheric chemistry.
