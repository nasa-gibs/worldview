The Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) Water Vapor (H2O) Mixing Ratio layer at 46hPa (hectopascals) indicates water vapor levels at the vertical atmospheric pressure level of 46hPa, and is measured in parts per million by volume (ppmv).

The MLS Water Vapor (H2O) Mixing Ratio 46hPa layer is derived from the MLS Water Vapor product (ML2H2O_NRT) available from the Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) instrument on the Aura satellite. The sensor resolution is 5km, imagery resolution is 2km, and the temporal resolution is daily.
