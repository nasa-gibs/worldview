The Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) Carbon Monoxide (CO) Mixing Ratio layer at 215 hPa (hectopascals) indicates carbon monoxide levels at the vertical atmospheric pressure level of 215hPa, and is measured in parts per billion by volume (ppbv).

The MLS Carbon Monoxide (CO) Mixing Ratio 215hPa layer is derived from the MLS Carbon Monoxide product (ML2CO_NRT) available from the Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) instrument on the Aura satellite. The sensor resolution is 5 km, imagery resolution is 2 km, and the temporal resolution is daily.
