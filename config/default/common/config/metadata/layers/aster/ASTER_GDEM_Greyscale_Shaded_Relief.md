The ASTER Global Digital Elevation Model (GDEM) Greyscale Shaded Relief layer shows surface elevation as shaded relief in shades of grey. Features such as mountains, valleys, plateaus and canyons with steep slopes will appear more rough, while flat areas will appear more smooth.

The Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) instrument is on board the Terra satellite. The ASTER GDEM (version 2) is a static product. It was created from approximately 1.5 million scenes (ASTER stereo pair observations) dating back to 2000 and covers land surfaces between 83°N and 83°S. ASTER GDEM data have a resolution of 30 meters.
