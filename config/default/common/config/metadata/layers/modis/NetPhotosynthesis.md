### MODIS (Terra/Aqua) Net Photosynthesis (Level 4, 8-Day)
Temporal coverage: 26 February 2000 - present (Terra); 4 July 2002 - present (Aqua)

The Net Photosynthesis (L4, 8-Day) layers are created from the MOD17A2H/MYD17A2H Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) product which is a cumulative 8-day composite of values with 500 meter (m) pixel size based on the radiation use efficiency concept that can be potentially used as inputs to data models to calculate terrestrial energy, carbon, water cycle processes, and biogeochemistry of vegetation. The Net Photosynthesis (PSN) band values are the GPP less the Maintenance Respiration (MR).

NOTE: We are reprocessing the entire MODIS Land imagery archive to collection 6.1 but currently the imagery is a mix of collection 6 and collection 6.1. Most of the imagery from mid-May 2021 onwards is collection 6.1 and older imagery is collection 6.
