### MODIS (Terra/Aqua) Fraction of Photosynthetically Active Radiation (Level 4, 8-Day)
Temporal coverage: 26 February 2000 - present (Terra); 4 July 2002 - present (Aqua)

The Fraction of Photosynthetically Active Radiation (L4, 8-Day) layers are created from the MOD15A2H/MYD15A2H Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) combined Leaf Area Index (LAI) and Fraction of Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FPAR) product which is an 8-day composite dataset with 500 meter (m) pixel size. The algorithm chooses the “best” pixel available from all the acquisitions of the Terra sensor from within the 8-day period.

FPAR is defined as the fraction of incident photosynthetically active radiation (400-700 nm) absorbed by the green elements of a vegetation canopy.
