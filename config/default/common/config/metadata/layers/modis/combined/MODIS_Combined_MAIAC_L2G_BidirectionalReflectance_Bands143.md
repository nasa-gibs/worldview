The MAIAC Reflectance (BRDF-Adjusted) layer is an RGB image of Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) surface reflectance (SR) over land based on MODIS bands 1, 4, 3, normalized to a fixed geometry of nadir view and 45&deg; sun angle using MAIAC BRDF. The image is produced over cloud-free land and coastal ocean daily, at 1km resolution.

MAIAC Collection 6 provides daily SR at 1km (bands 1-12) and 500m (bands 1-7) resolution (product MCD19A1) separately for MODIS Terra and Aqua.  MAIAC BRDF model is reported for MODIS bands 1-12 at 1km resolution once every 8 days.

The MAIAC Reflectance (BRDF-Adjusted) layer is available as a combined Terra satellite and Aqua satellite layer (MCD19A1). The sensor resolution is 1 km, imagery resolution is 1 km, and the temporal resolution is daily.
