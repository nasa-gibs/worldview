### MODIS (Terra and Aqua) Leaf Area Index (Level 4, 4-Day)
Temporal coverage: 4 July 2002 - present

The MCD15A3H Version 6 Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Level 4 Leaf Area Index (LAI) product is a 4-day composite data set with 500 meter pixel size. The algorithm chooses the best pixel available from all the acquisitions of both MODIS sensors located on NASA’s Terra and Aqua satellites from within the 4-day period.

LAI is defined as the one-sided green leaf area per unit ground area in broadleaf canopies and as one-half the total needle surface area per unit ground area in coniferous canopies.

### MODIS (Terra and Aqua) Leaf Area Index (Level 4, 8-Day)
Temporal coverage: 4 July 2002 - present

The MCD15A2H Version 6 Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Level 4 Leaf Area Index (LAI) product is an 8-day composite dataset with 500 meter pixel size. The algorithm chooses the best pixel available from all the acquisitions of both MODIS sensors located on NASA’s Terra and Aqua satellites from within the 8-day period.

LAI is defined as the one-sided green leaf area per unit ground area in broadleaf canopies and as one-half the total needle surface area per unit ground area in coniferous canopies.
