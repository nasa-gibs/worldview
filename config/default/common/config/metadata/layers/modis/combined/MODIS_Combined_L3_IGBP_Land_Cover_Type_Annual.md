The Terra and Aqua combined Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Land Cover Type (MCD12Q1) Version 6 data product provides global land cover types at yearly intervals. The MCD12Q1 Version 6 data product is derived using supervised classifications of MODIS Terra and Aqua reflectance data. The supervised classifications then undergo additional post-processing that incorporate prior knowledge and ancillary information to further refine specific classes. This layer defines land cover type based on the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP) classification scheme. The classification legend and class descriptions are listed in section 5 of the [User Guide](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/101/MCD12_User_Guide_V6.pdf).
