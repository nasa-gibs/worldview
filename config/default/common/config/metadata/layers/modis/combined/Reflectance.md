### MODIS (Terra and Aqua) Reflectance (Level 3, BRDF-Adjusted, Daily)
Temporal coverage: 18 May 2000 - present

The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) MCD43A4 Version 6 Nadir Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF)-Adjusted Reflectance (NBAR) dataset is produced daily using 16 days of Terra and Aqua MODIS data at 500 meter (m) resolution. The view angle effects are removed from the directional reflectances, resulting in a stable and consistent NBAR product. Data are temporally weighted to the ninth day which is reflected in the Julian date in the file name. This NBAR layer is a representation of MODIS reflectance bands 1, 4 and 3.

### MAIAC Reflectance (BRDF-Adjusted)
Temporal coverage: 28 September 2019 - present

The MAIAC Reflectance (BRDF-Adjusted) layer is an RGB image of Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) surface reflectance (SR) over land based on MODIS bands 1, 4, 3, normalized to a fixed geometry of nadir view and 45&deg; sun angle using MAIAC BRDF. The image is produced over cloud-free land and coastal ocean daily, at 1km resolution.

MAIAC Collection 6 provides daily SR at 1km (bands 1-12) and 500m (bands 1-7) resolution (product MCD19A1) separately for MODIS Terra and Aqua.  MAIAC BRDF model is reported for MODIS bands 1-12 at 1km resolution once every 8 days.

The MAIAC Reflectance (BRDF-Adjusted) layer is available as a combined Terra satellite and Aqua satellite layer (MCD19A1). The sensor resolution is 1 km, imagery resolution is 1 km, and the temporal resolution is daily.
