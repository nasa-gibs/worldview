### MODIS (Terra/Aqua) Ice Surface Temperature (Day | Night)
Temporal Coverage: 24 February 2000 - present (Terra); 3 July 2002 - present (Aqua)

The MODIS Sea Ice Surface Temperature layer shows the surface temperature of Arctic and Antarctic sea ice estimated using the thermal emissive bands in the MODIS instrument. The Ice surface temperature is estimated for the cloud free ocean pixels only. Ice Surface Temperature (IST) controls snow metamorphosis and melt, the rate of sea ice growth, and air–sea heat exchange and is an important parameter in large-scale modeling.

The MODIS Ice Surface Temperature product is available from both the Terra (MOD29) and Aqua (MYD29) satellites. The sensor and imagery resolution is 1km, and the temporal resolution is daily.

### MODIS (Terra/Aqua) Ice Surface Temperature (Level 3, Daily, Day | Night)
Temporal Coverage: 24 February 2000 - present (Terra); 3 July 2002 - present (Aqua)

The MODIS/Terra | MODIS/Aqua Ice Surface Temperature Day | Night layer shows daily, daytime | night-time ice surface temperature in Kelvin, mapped to a 1 km tile. Ice surface temperature is obtained from the MODIS/Terra | MODIS/Aqua Sea Ice Extent 5-Min L2 Swath 1km, Version 6 (MOD29 | MYD29) data set. Each MOD29P1D | MYD29P1D tile consists of the best IST swath observation of the day selected from MOD29 | MYD29.

The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) is a 36-band visible to thermal-infrared sensor onboard the Terra and Aqua satellites. Two of the bands are imaged at a nominal resolution of 250 m at nadir, five bands at 500 m, and the remaining bands at 1000 m.

Ice Surface Temperature (IST) is useful for understanding snow metamorphosis and melt, the rate of sea ice growth, and air–sea heat exchange.
