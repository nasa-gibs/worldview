### MODIS (Terra/Aqua) Sea Ice Extent
Temporal Coverage: 24 February 2000 - present (Terra); 3 July 2002 - present (Aqua)

The MODIS Sea Ice extent layer shows the presence of sea ice. Ice forms in the sea when air and sea temperatures are consistently cold.  Some areas of the sea in the world are consistently covered in sea ice and the sea ice even builds up to form multi year ice packs, some areas only form sea ice in the winter. The presence of sea ice changes the normally dark blue ocean into solid white ice. This has an effect on the weather and Earthâ€™s climate. Sunlight that would normally be absorbed by the dark blue ocean is now reflected back by the ice, increasing the surface albedo. Sea ice regulates the amount of heat that escapes the ocean surface to warm the atmosphere. For near real-time applications, MODIS Sea Ice layer is useful for assessing the presence of sea ice in the ocean and other large water bodies. The presence of sea ice prohibits the passage of ships through the waters and an ice breaker vessel may be required to break up the ice before a ship may pass.  

The MODIS Sea Ice product is available from both the Terra (MOD29) and Aqua (MYD29) satellites. The sensor and imagery resolution is 1 km, and the temporal resolution is daily.

### MODIS (Aqua/Terra) Sea Ice Extent (Level 3, Daily)
Temporal Coverage: 24 February 2000 - present (Terra); 4 July 2002 - present (Aqua)

The MODIS/Terra | MODIS/Aqua Sea Ice Extent Daily layer shows the daily, daytime presence of sea ice in 1 km tiles. Sea ice is obtained from the MODIS/Terra | MODIS/Aqua Sea Ice Extent 5-Min L2 Swath 1km, Version 6 (MOD29 | MYD29) data set. Each MOD29P1D | MYD29P1D tile consists of the best sea ice swath observation of the day selected from MOD29 | MYD29. Sea ice is detected using the Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI) snow cover algorithm. The algorithm assumes that sea ice is snow-covered and that the NDSI can be used to detect sea ice. Sea ice detection is constrained to daylight ocean pixels that have visible reflectance above 10 percent and are not obstructed by clouds.

The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) is a 36-band visible to thermal-infrared sensor onboard the Terra and Aqua satellites. Two of the bands are imaged at a nominal resolution of 250 m at nadir, five bands at 500 m, and the remaining bands at 1000 m.

Sea Ice data is useful for marine navigation, environmental monitoring, and climate forecasting.
