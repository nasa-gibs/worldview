The MODIS Land Surface Temperature (L3, Daily, Day) layer shows the daily, day-time land surface temperature in Kelvin (K). It is created from the MOD11A1 product which provides daily per-pixel Land Surface Temperature and Emissivity (LST&E) with 1 kilometer (km) spatial resolution. The pixel temperature value is derived from the Terra MODIS LST&E swath product. Above 30 degrees latitude, some pixels may have multiple observations where the criteria for clear-sky are met. When this occurs, the pixel value is a result of the average of all qualifying observations. The Land Surface Temperature layer is a representation of daytime LST.

NOTE: We are reprocessing the entire MODIS Land imagery archive to collection 6.1 but currently the imagery is a mix of collection 6 and collection 6.1. Most of the imagery from mid-May 2021 onwards is collection 6.1 and older imagery is collection 6.
