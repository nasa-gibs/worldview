The MODIS/Terra Snow Cover Monthly Average layer displays the average monthly snow cover as a percentage for each 0.05 km Climate Modeling Grid (CMG) cell. Monthly averages are computed from daily snow cover observations in the MODIS/Terra Snow Cover Daily L3 Global 0.05Deg CMG, Version 6 (MOD10C1) data set. Snow cover is detected using the Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI) snow cover algorithm and shows the presence of snow during day time and under cloud free condition only.

The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) is a 36-band visible to thermal-infrared sensor onboard the Terra and Aqua satellites. Two of the bands are imaged at a nominal resolution of 250 m at nadir, five bands at 500 m, and the remaining bands at 1000 m.

Seasonal snow cover is an important part of Earth’s climate system. It helps regulate the Earth’s surface temperature and is crucial for predicting snow and flooding.
