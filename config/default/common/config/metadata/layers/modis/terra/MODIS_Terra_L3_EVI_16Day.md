The Enhanced Vegetation Index (L3, 16 Day) layer is created from the Terra Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Vegetation Indices (MOD13Q1) data which are generated every 16 days at 250 meter (m) spatial resolution as a Level 3 product. The MOD13Q1 product provides the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), which has improved sensitivity over high biomass regions. The algorithm chooses the best available pixel value from all the acquisitions from the 16-day period. The criteria used is low clouds, low view angle, and the highest EVI value.

The Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) minimizes canopy background variations and maintains sensitivity over dense vegetation conditions. The EVI uses the blue band to remove residual atmosphere contamination caused by smoke and sub-pixel thin clouds. The MODIS EVI product is computed from surface reflectances corrected for molecular scattering, ozone absorption, and aerosols.
