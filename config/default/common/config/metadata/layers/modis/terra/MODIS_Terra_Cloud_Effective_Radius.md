**4 May 2021 Notice**: The MODIS instrument aboard the Terra satellite experienced a Printed Wire Assembly (PWA) failure on 5 The MODIS Cloud Effective Radius layer is a measure of cloud particle size in microns (μm). It is retrieved globally during day time for liquid and ice phases. This layer is the Cloud Effective Radius retrieval using Band 7 (2.1 μm). It is simultaneously retrieved with Cloud Optical Thickness by simultaneously measuring the reflection function of a non-absorbing and absorbing spectral channel (e.g., Visible/Near Infrared (VIS/NIR) and Shortwave Infrared (SWIR), respectively) and comparing the resulting measurements with theoretical forward model calculations. Generally, smaller the particle size, brighter and more reflective are the clouds. The smaller cloud particles tend to reflect and scatter more sunlight back into space.

The MODIS Cloud Effective Radius layers are available from both the Terra (MOD06) and Aqua (MYD06) satellites for daytime overpasses. The sensor/algorithm resolution is 1 km, imagery resolution is 1 km, and the temporal resolution is daily.
