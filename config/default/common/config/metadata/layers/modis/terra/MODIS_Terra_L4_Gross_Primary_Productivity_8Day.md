The Gross Primary Production (L4, 8-Day) layer is created from the MOD17A2H Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) product which is a cumulative 8-day composite of values with 500 meter (m) pixel size based on the radiation use efficiency concept for the current year. It can be potentially used as inputs to data models to calculate terrestrial energy, carbon, water cycle processes, and biogeochemistry of vegetation.

For previous years, the Gross Primary Production (L4, 8-Day) layer is created from the MOD17A2HGF product. It is generated at the end of each year when the entire yearly 8-day MYD15A2H is available. Hence, the gap-filled MOD17A2HGF is the improved MYD17, which has cleaned the poor-quality inputs from 8-day Leaf Area Index and Fraction of Photosynthetically Active Radiation (LAI/FPAR) based on the Quality Control (QC) label for every pixel. If any LAI/FPAR pixel did not meet the quality screening criteria, its value is determined through linear interpolation.

The sensor and imagery resolution is 500m, and the temporal resolution is 8-day.
