The Enhanced Vegetation Index (L3, Monthly) layer is created from from the Terra Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Vegetation Indices (MOD13A3) data which are provided monthly at 1 kilometer (km) spatial resolution as a gridded Level 3 product. In generating this monthly product, the algorithm ingests all the Terra MODIS Vegetation Indices 16-day products that overlap the month and employs a weighted temporal average.

The Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) minimizes canopy background variations and maintains sensitivity over dense vegetation conditions. The EVI uses the blue band to remove residual atmosphere contamination caused by smoke and sub-pixel thin clouds. The MODIS EVI product is computed from surface reflectances corrected for molecular scattering, ozone absorption, and aerosols.
