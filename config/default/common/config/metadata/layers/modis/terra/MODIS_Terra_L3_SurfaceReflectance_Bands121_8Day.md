False Color: Red = Band 1, Green = Band 2, Blue = Band 1

The Land Surface Reflectance (L3, 8-Day, Bands 1-2-1) layer is created from the MOD09Q1 product which provides an estimate of the surface spectral reflectance of Terra Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Bands 1 and 2, corrected for atmospheric conditions such as gasses, aerosols, and Rayleigh scattering. Provided along with the 250 meter (m) surface reflectance bands are two quality layers. For each pixel, a value is selected from all the acquisitions within the 8-day composite period. The criteria for the pixel choice include cloud and solar zenith. When several acquisitions meet the criteria the pixel with the minimum channel 3 (blue) value is used.

Vegetation is very reflective in the near infrared (Band 2), and absorbent in Band 1. Assigning band 2 to green means even the smallest hint of vegetation will appear bright green in the image. Liquid water on the ground will be very dark since it absorbs in the red and the SWIR and sediments in water appear pink. This band combination is good for identifying vegetation changes, drought and floods.
