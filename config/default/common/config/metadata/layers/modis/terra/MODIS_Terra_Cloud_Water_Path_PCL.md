**8 November 2020 Notice**: The MODIS instrument aboard the Terra satellite experienced a Printed Wire Assembly (PWA) failure on 5 October 2020. This has resulted in a reduction in the overall Terra daytime coverage and many of the MODIS/Terra imagery layers have a slightly jagged appearance with less coverage over the northern high latitude regions. This issue will affect land daytime MODIS/Terra products that primarily rely on the Reflective Solar Bands (RSB) (i.e. visible bands) indefinitely. [Learn more about the issue](https://landweb.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/QA_WWW/displayCase.cgi?esdt=MOD&caseNum=PM_MOD_20280&caseLocation=cases_data&type=C6).

The MODIS Cloud Water Path indicates the amount of water in the atmosphere above a unit surface area of the Earth. It is measured in grams per square meter (g/m<sup>2</sup>) and is globally retrieved for liquid and ice cloud phases. This layer is the Column Water Path retrieved using Band 7 (2.1 μm) for pixels classified as either partly cloudy from 250 m cloud mask test or 1 km cloud edges. Cloud water path forms a link between radiative and hydrological properties of the Earth’s climate system.

The MODIS Cloud Water Path layers available are: (1) the MODIS Cloud Water Path layer is the Column Water Path retrieved using Band 7 (2.1 μm); and (2) the MODIS Cloud Water Path PCL (partly cloudy) layer is the Column Water Path retrieved using Band 7 (2.1 μm) for pixels classified as either partly cloudy from 250 m cloud mask test or 1 km cloud edges.

The MODIS Cloud Water Path layers are available from both the Terra (MOD06) and Aqua (MYD06) satellites for daytime overpasses. The sensor/algorithm resolution is 1 km, imagery resolution is 1 km, and the temporal resolution is daily.
