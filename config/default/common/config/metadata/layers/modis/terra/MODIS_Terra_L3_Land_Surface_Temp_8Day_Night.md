The MODIS Land Surface Temperature (L3, 8-Day, Night) layer displays 8-day night time land surface temperature in Kelvin (K). It is created from the MOD11A2 product which provides an average 8-day per-pixel Land Surface Temperature and Emissivity (LST&E) with a 1 kilometer (km) spatial resolution. Each pixel value in the MOD11A2 is a simple average of all the corresponding Terra MODIS Land Surface Temperature & Emissivity (LST&E) daily pixels collected within that 8-day period. The 8-day compositing period was chosen because twice that period is the exact ground track repeat period of the Terra and Aqua platforms. The Land Surface Temperature layer is a representation of nighttime LST.

NOTE: We are reprocessing the entire MODIS Land imagery archive to collection 6.1 but currently the imagery is a mix of collection 6 and collection 6.1. Most of the imagery from mid-May 2021 onwards is collection 6.1 and older imagery is collection 6.
