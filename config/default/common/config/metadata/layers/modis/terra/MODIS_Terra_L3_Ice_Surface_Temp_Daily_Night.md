The MODIS/Terra Ice Surface Temperature layer shows daily, night-time, ice surface temperature in Kelvin, mapped to a 1 km tile. Ice surface temperature is obtained from the MODIS/Terra Sea Ice Extent 5-Min L2 Swath 1km, Version 6 (MOD29) data set. Each MOD29P1D tile consists of the best IST swath observation of the day selected from MOD29.

The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) is a 36-band visible to thermal-infrared sensor onboard the Terra and Aqua satellites. Two of the bands are imaged at a nominal resolution of 250 m at nadir, five bands at 500 m, and the remaining bands at 1000 m.

Ice Surface Temperature (IST) is useful for understanding snow metamorphosis and melt, the rate of sea ice growth, and air–sea heat exchange.
