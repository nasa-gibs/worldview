The Leaf Area Index (L4, 8-Day) layer is created from the MOD15A2H Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) combined Leaf Area Index (LAI) and Fraction of Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FPAR) product which is an 8-day composite dataset with 500 meter (m) pixel size. The algorithm chooses the “best” pixel available from all the acquisitions of the Terra sensor from within the 8-day period.

LAI is defined as the one-sided green leaf area per unit ground area in broadleaf canopies and as one-half the total needle surface area per unit ground area in coniferous canopies.

NOTE: We are reprocessing the entire MODIS Land imagery archive to collection 6.1 but currently the imagery is a mix of collection 6 and collection 6.1. Most of the imagery from mid-May 2021 onwards is collection 6.1 and older imagery is collection 6.
