The MODIS Chlorophyll *a* layer provides the near-surface concentration of chlorophyll *a* in milligrams of chlorophyll pigment per cubic meter (mg/m<sup>3</sup>) in the ocean.

The MODIS Chlorophyll *a* product is available from both the Terra and Aqua satellites. The sensor and imagery resolution is 1 km, and the temporal resolution is daily.
