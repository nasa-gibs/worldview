The MODIS/Terra Snow Cover with Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI) layer displays daily snow cover in 10 degree x 10 degree tiles at a resolution of 500 meters. Snow cover is obtained from the MODIS/Terra Snow Cover 5-Min L2 Swath 500m, Version 6 (MOD10_L2) data set. Each MOD10A1 tile consists of the best swath observation of the day selected from MOD10_L2. Snow cover is detected using the Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI) snow cover algorithm and shows the presence of snow during day time and under cloud free condition only.

The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) is a 36-band visible to thermal-infrared sensor onboard the Terra and Aqua satellites. Two of the bands are imaged at a nominal resolution of 250 m at nadir, five bands at 500 m, and the remaining bands at 1000 m.

Seasonal snow cover is an important part of Earth’s climate system. It helps regulate the Earth’s surface temperature and is crucial for predicting snow and flooding.
