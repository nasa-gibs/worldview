### MODIS (Terra/Aqua) Snow Cover (Normalized Difference Snow Index)
Temporal Coverage: 24 February 2000 - present (Terra); 3 July 2002 - present (Aqua)

The MODIS/Terra | MODIS/Aqua Snow Cover (Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI)) layers show the presence of snow cover over land and water bodies as an index related to the presence of snow. NDSI snow cover is derived from the cloud free snow reflectance sensed by the MODIS instrument, and hence this layer shows presence of snow during day time and under cloud clear condition only. NDSI snow cover though could be retrieved in the valid range of (0, 1.0) at every pixel, additional tests like surface temperature screening linked with the surface height is used for accurate detection. Snow is precipitation that forms from water vapor in the atmosphere where temperatures are below 0° Celsius. If the ground temperature is also below freezing, snow will accumulate on the ground as bright, white layer of snowpack. Snow cover reflects sunlight back into the atmosphere, helping to cool the Earth’s surface. Snowmelt is used for drinking water, water for crop irrigation, and can moisturize soil to reduce the risk of wildfire in many areas in the world. When snow melts in the spring, too much snow can cause springtime flooding.

The MODIS Snow Cover (Normalized Difference Snow Index) layer is available from both the Terra (MOD10) and Aqua (MYD10) satellites. The sensor and imagery resolution is 500 m and the temporal resolution is daily.

### MODIS (Terra/Aqua) Snow Cover (Normalized Difference Snow Index, Level 3, Daily)
Temporal coverage: 24 February 2000 - present (Terra); 3 July 2002 - present (Aqua)

The MODIS/Terra | MODIS/Aqua Snow Cover (Normalized Difference Snow Index, L3, Daily) layers display daily snow cover in 10 degree x 10 degree tiles at a resolution of 500 meters. Snow cover is obtained from the MODIS/Terra | MODIS/Aqua Snow Cover 5-Min L2 Swath 500m (MYD10_L2 | MYD10_L2) data set. Each MOD10A1 | MYD10A1 tile consists of the best swath observation of the day selected from MOD10_L2 | MYD10_L2. Snow cover is detected using the Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI) sea ice algorithm and shows the presence of snow during day time and under cloud free condition only.

Seasonal snow cover is an important part of Earth’s climate system. It helps regulate the Earth’s surface temperature and is crucial for predicting snow and flooding.

The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) is a 36-band visible to thermal-infrared sensor onboard the Terra and Aqua satellites. Two of the bands are imaged at a nominal resolution of 250 m at nadir, five bands at 500 m, and the remaining bands at 1000 m.

### MODIS (Terra/Aqua) Days with Snow Cover (Level 3, Monthly, Average Percent)
Temporal coverage: March 2000 - present (Terra); 1 July 2002 - present (Aqua)

The MODIS/Terra | MODIS/Aqua Days with Snow (L3, Monthly, Average Percent) layers display the average monthly snow cover as a percentage for each 0.05 km Climate Modeling Grid (CMG) cell. Monthly averages are computed from daily snow cover observations in the MODIS/Terra Snow Cover Daily L3 Global 0.05Deg CMG (MOD10C1) data set. Snow cover is detected using the Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI) snow cover algorithm and shows the presence of snow during day time and under cloud free condition only.

NOTE: We are reprocessing the entire MODIS Land imagery archive to collection 6.1 but currently the imagery is a mix of collection 6 and collection 6.1. Most of the imagery from mid-May 2021 onwards is collection 6.1 and older imagery is collection 6.
