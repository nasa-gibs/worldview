The MYD11A2 Version 6 product provides an average 8-day per-pixel Land Surface Temperature and Emissivity (LST&E) with a 1 kilometer (km) spatial resolution in a 1,200 by 1,200 km grid. Each pixel value in the MYD11A2 is a simple average of all the corresponding Aqua MODIS LST&E daily pixels collected within that 8-day period. The 8-day compositing period was chosen because twice that period is the exact ground track repeat period of the Terra and Aqua platforms. The Land Surface Temperature Night layer is a representation of nighttime LST.
