The MODIS Cloud Water Path indicates the amount of water in the atmosphere above a unit surface area of the Earth. It is measured in grams per square meter (g/m<sup>2</sup>) and is globally retrieved for liquid and ice cloud phases. This layer is the Column Water Path retrieved using Band 7 (2.1 μm). Cloud water path forms a link between radiative and hydrological properties of the Earth’s climate system.=

The MODIS Cloud Water Path layers are available from both the Terra (MOD06) and Aqua (MYD06) satellites for daytime overpasses. The sensor/algorithm resolution is 1 km, imagery resolution is 1 km, and the temporal resolution is daily.
