The Gross Primary Production - Gap Filled (L4, 8-Day) layer is created from the MYD17A2H Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) product which is a cumulative 8-day composite of values with 500 meter (m) pixel size based on the radiation use efficiency concept that can be potentially used as inputs to data models to calculate terrestrial energy, carbon, water cycle processes, and biogeochemistry of vegetation.

The MYD17A2HGF product is generated at the end of each year when the entire yearly 8-day MYD15A2H is available. Hence, the gap-filled MYD17A2HGF is the improved MYD17, which has cleaned the poor-quality inputs from 8-day Leaf Area Index and Fraction of Photosynthetically Active Radiation (LAI/FPAR) based on the Quality Control (QC) label for every pixel. If any LAI/FPAR pixel did not meet the quality screening criteria, its value is determined through linear interpolation.

The sensor and imagery resolution is 500m, and the temporal resolution is 8-day, and the product is available at the end of each year.
