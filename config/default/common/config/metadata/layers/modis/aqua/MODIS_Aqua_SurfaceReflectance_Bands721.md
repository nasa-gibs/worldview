False Color: Red = Band 7, Green = Band 2, Blue = Band 1

This combination is most useful for distinguishing burn scars from naturally low vegetation or bare soil and enhancing floods. Vegetation will appear green and burned areas will appear reddish.

The MODIS Land Surface Reflectance product is available from both the Terra (MOD09) and Aqua (MYD09) satellites. The sensor resolution is 500 m, imagery resolution is 500 m, and the temporal resolution is daily.

#### Vegetation and bare ground
Vegetation is very reflective in the near infrared (Band 2), and absorbent in Band 1 and Band 7. Assigning that band to green means even the smallest hint of vegetation will appear bright green in the image. Naturally bare soil, like a desert, is reflective in all bands used in this image, but more so in the SWIR (Band 7, red) and so soils will often have a pinkish tinge.

#### Burned areas
When vegetation burns, burned area or fire-affected areas become characterized by deposits of charcoal and ash, removal of vegetation and/or alteration of vegetation structure. When bare soil is exposed, the brightness in Band 1 usually slightly increases, but that may be offset by the presence of black carbon residue. The near infrared (Band 2) will become darker, and Band 7 becomes more reflective. When assigned to red in the image, Band 7 will show burn scars as deep or bright red, depending on the type of vegetation burned, the amount of residue, or the completeness of the burn.

#### Water
Liquid water on the ground will be very dark since it absorbs in the red and the SWIR. Sediments in water appear dark blue. Ice and snow appear as bright turquoise. Clouds comprised of small water droplets scatter light equally in both the visible and the SWIR and will appear white. These clouds are usually lower to the ground and warmer. High and cold clouds are comprised of ice crystals and will appear turquoise.
