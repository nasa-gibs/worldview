The MODIS L3 SST 4km layer shows global nighttime sea surface temperature (SST) at a depth of a few micrometers with ranges from -1.8 to 32 degree Celsius. The SST is derived with a Thermal (Long–Wave) SST Algorithm that uses MODIS bands 31 and 32 at 11 and 12 μm. This Level 3 product is derived from native 1 km Level 2 SST observations that are mapped to a global 4.63 km grid. The temporal resolution of this MODIS L3 SST is daily.
