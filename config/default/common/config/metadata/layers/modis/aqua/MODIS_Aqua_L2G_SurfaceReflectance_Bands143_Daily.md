True Color: Red = Band 1, Green = Band 4, Blue = Band 3

The Land Surface Reflectance (L2G, Daily, True Color) later is created from the MYD09GA product which provides an estimate of the surface spectral reflectance of Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Bands 1 through 7, corrected for atmospheric conditions such as gasses, aerosols, and Rayleigh scattering. Provided along with the 500 meter (m) surface reflectance, observation, and quality bands are a set of ten 1 km observation bands and geolocation flags. The reflectance layers from the MYD09GA are used as the source data for many of the MODIS land products.

These images are called true-color or natural color because this combination of wavelengths is similar to what the human eye would see. The images are natural-looking images of land surface, oceanic and atmospheric features.
