The MODIS/Aqua Snow Cover 8-Day Layer shows the maximum snow cover extent, observed over an eight-day period, provided in 10 degree x 10 degree tiles. Tiles are generated by compositing 500 m observations from the MODIS/Aqua Snow Cover Daily L3 Global 500 m SIN Grid, Version 6 (MYD10A1) data set. Snow cover is detected using the Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI) snow cover algorithm and shows the presence of snow during day time and under cloud free condition only.

The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) is a 36-band visible to thermal-infrared sensor onboard the Terra and Aqua satellites. Two of the bands are imaged at a nominal resolution of 250 m at nadir, five bands at 500 m, and the remaining bands at 1000 m.

Seasonal snow cover is an important part of Earth’s climate system. It helps regulate the Earth’s surface temperature and is crucial for predicting snow and flooding.
