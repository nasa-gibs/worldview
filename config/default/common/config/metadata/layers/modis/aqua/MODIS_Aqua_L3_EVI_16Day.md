The Enhanced Vegetation Index (L3, 16-Day) layer is created from the Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Vegetation Indices (MYD13Q1) data which are generated every 16 days at 250 meter (m) spatial resolution as a Level 3 product. The MYD13Q1 product provides the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), which has improved sensitivity over high biomass regions. The algorithm chooses the best available pixel value from all the acquisitions from the 16-day period. The criteria used is low clouds, low view angle, and the highest EVI value.

The Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) minimizes canopy background variations and maintains sensitivity over dense vegetation conditions. The EVI uses the blue band to remove residual atmosphere contamination caused by smoke and sub-pixel thin clouds. The MODIS EVI product is computed from surface reflectances corrected for molecular scattering, ozone absorption, and aerosols.

Vegetation indices are used for global monitoring of vegetation conditions and are used in products displaying land cover and land cover changes. These data may be used as input for modeling global biogeochemical and hydrologic processes as well as global and regional climate. Additional applications include characterizing land surface biophysical properties and processes, such as primary production and land cover conversion.

NOTE: We are reprocessing the entire MODIS Land imagery archive to collection 6.1 but currently the imagery is a mix of collection 6 and collection 6.1. Most of the imagery from mid-May 2021 onwards is collection 6.1 and older imagery is collection 6.
