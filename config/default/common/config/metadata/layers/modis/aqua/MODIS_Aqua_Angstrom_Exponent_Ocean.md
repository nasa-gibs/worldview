The MODIS Deep Blue Aerosol Ångström Exponent layer can be used to provide additional information on the aerosol particle size over ocean. This layer is created from the Dark Target (DT) algorithm that retrieves over ocean (dark in visible and longer wavelengths). The Ångström exponent provides additional information on the particle size (larger the exponent, the smaller the particle size). Values < 1 suggest optical dominance of coarse particles (e.g. dust) and values > 1 suggest optical dominance of fine particles (e.g. smoke).

The MODIS Dark Target Aerosol Aerosol Ångström Exponent (Ocean) layer is available from both the Terra (MOD04_L2) and Aqua (MYD04_L2) satellites for daytime overpasses. The sensor/algorithm resolution is 10 km at nadir, imagery resolution is 2 km at nadir,and the temporal resolution is daily. Resolution is much coarser out toward the edge of the swath.

### Aerosol Optical Depth
Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) (or Aerosol Optical Thickness) indicates the level at which particles in the air (aerosols) prevent light from traveling through the atmosphere. Aerosols scatter and absorb incoming sunlight, which reduces visibility. From an observer on the ground, an AOD of less than 0.1 is “clean” - characteristic of clear blue sky, bright sun and maximum visibility. As AOD increases to 0.5, 1.0, and greater than 3.0, aerosols become so dense that sun is obscured. Sources of aerosols include pollution from factories, smoke from fires, dust from dust storms, sea salt, and volcanic ash and smog. Aerosols compromise human health when inhaled by people, particularly those with asthma or other respiratory illnesses. Aerosols also have an effect on the weather and climate by cooling or warming the earth, helping or preventing clouds from forming. Since aerosols are difficult to identify when they occur over different types of land surfaces and ocean surfaces, Worldview provides several different types of imagery layers to assist in the identification.
