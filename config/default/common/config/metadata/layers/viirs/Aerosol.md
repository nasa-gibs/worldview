### Aerosol Optical Depth
Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) (or Aerosol Optical Thickness) indicates the level at which particles in the air (aerosols) prevent light from traveling through the atmosphere. Aerosols scatter and absorb incoming sunlight, which reduces visibility. From an observer on the ground, an AOD of less than 0.1 is “clean” - characteristic of clear blue sky, bright sun and maximum visibility. As AOD increases to 0.5, 1.0, and greater than 3.0, aerosols become so dense that sun is obscured. Sources of aerosols include pollution from factories, smoke from fires, dust from dust storms, sea salt, and volcanic ash and smog. Aerosols compromise human health when inhaled by people, particularly those with asthma or other respiratory illnesses. Aerosols also have an effect on the weather and climate by cooling or warming the Earth, helping or preventing clouds from forming. Since aerosols are difficult to identify when they occur over different types of land surfaces and ocean surfaces, Worldview provides several different types of imagery layers to assist in the identification.

### Deep Blue Aerosol Optical Thickness
Temporal coverage: 1 March 2012 - present

The VIIRS Deep Blue Aerosol Optical Thickness layer is useful for studying aerosol optical depth over the ocean as well as vegetation/dark-soiled land, which are both dark in the visible wavelengths.

This layer is the combined Aerosol Optical Depth at 550 nm, only populated for those retrieval pixels passing quality assurance tests. It is created from the Deep Blue (DB) algorithm over land and the Satellite Ocean Aerosol Retrieval (SOAR) algorithm over water to determine atmospheric aerosol loading for day time cloud-free snow-free scenes. This data product is designed to facilitate continuity in the aerosol record provided by the Deep Blue aerosol project for other sensors including the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) and Terra/Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometers (MODIS).

The VIIRS Deep Blue Aerosol Optical Thickness layer is available from the joint NASA/NOAA Suomi National Polar orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP) satellite (`AERDB_L2_VIIRS_SNPP_NRT`) for the daytime overpass. The sensor/algorithm resolution is 6 km at nadir, imagery resolution is 2 km at nadir, and the temporal resolution is daily. Resolution is much coarser out toward the edge of the swath.

### Deep Blue Aerosol Angstrom Exponent
Temporal coverage: 1 March 2012 - present

The VIIRS Deep Blue Aerosol Angstrom Exponent layer can be used to provide additional information related to the aerosol particle size over land and ocean (larger the exponent, the smaller the particle size). Values < 1 suggest optical dominance of coarse particles (e.g. dust) and values > 1 suggest optical dominance of fine particles (e.g. smoke).

Ångström exponent over land is defined between 412-470 nm for 'bright' surfaces, and 470-670 nm for 'dark' surfaces. The combined Ångström exponent over land and ocean are for those retrieval pixels passing quality assurance tests. This layer is created from the Deep Blue (DB) algorithm over land and the Satellite Ocean Aerosol Retrieval (SOAR) algorithm over water to determine atmospheric aerosol loading for day time cloud-free snow-free scenes. This data product is designed to facilitate continuity in the aerosol record provided by the Deep Blue aerosol project for other sensors including the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) and Terra/Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometers (MODIS).

The VIIRS Deep Blue Aerosol Ångström Exponent layer is available from the joint NASA/NOAA Suomi National Polar orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP) satellite (`AERDB_L2_VIIRS_SNPP_NRT`) for the daytime overpass. The sensor/algorithm resolution is 6 km at nadir, imagery resolution is 2 km at nadir, and the temporal resolution is daily. Resolution is much coarser out toward the edge of the swath.

### Dark Target Aerosol Optical Thickness
Temporal coverage: 1 March 2012 - present

The VIIRS Dark Target Aerosol Optical Thickness layer is useful for studying aerosol optical depth over the ocean as well as vegetation/dark-soiled land, which are both dark in the visible wavelengths.

This layer is created from two separate and distinct DT algorithms. One helps retrieve aerosol information over ocean (dark in visible and longer wavelengths), while the second aids retrievals over vegetated/dark-soiled land (dark in the visible).

The VIIRS Dark Target Aerosol Ångström Exponent layer is available from the joint NASA/NOAA Suomi National Polar orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP) satellite (`AERDT_L2_VIIRS_SNPP`) for the daytime overpass. The sensor/algorithm resolution is 6 km at nadir, imagery resolution is 2 km at nadir, and the temporal resolution is daily. Resolution is much coarser out toward the edge of the swath.
