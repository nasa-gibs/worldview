The VIIRS Brightness Temperature, Band I5, Day layer is the brightness temperature, measured in Kelvin (K), calculated from the top-of-the-atmosphere radiances. It does not provide an accurate temperature of either clouds nor the land surface, but it does show relative temperature differences which can be used to distinguish features both in clouds and over clear land. It can be used to distinguish land, sea ice, and open water over the polar regions during winter (in cloudless areas).

The VIIRS Brightness Temperature layer is calculated from VIIRS Calibrated Radiances. The VIIRS instrument is aboard the joint NASA/NOAA NOAA-20 (JPSS-1) satellite. The sensor resolution is 375m, the imagery resolution is 250m, and the temporal resolution is daily.
