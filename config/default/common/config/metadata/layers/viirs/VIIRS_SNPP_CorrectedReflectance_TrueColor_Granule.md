Granule Corrected Reflectance imagery displays each 6-minute granule of imagery in near real-time. It is available on a 15 day rolling window basis. Each granule shows imagery as it was captured by the VIIRS instrument in that 6-minute time period and reveals areas that may have otherwise been obscured by the mosaicking of subsequent overpasses.

For a daily overview, please refer to the associated Corrected Reflectance Mosaic/Composite image.

True Color: Red = Band I1, Green = Band M4, Blue = Band M3

These images are called true-color or natural color because this combination of wavelengths is similar to what the human eye would see. The images are natural-looking images of land surface, oceanic and atmospheric features.

The Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Corrected Reflectance imagery is available only as near real-time imagery. The VIIRS instrument in on board the joint NASA/NOAA Suomi National Polar orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP) satellite. The imagery can be visualized in Worldview and the Global Imagery Browse Services (GIBS). The sensor resolution is 750 m and 375 m (M Bands are 750 m, I Bands are 375 m), imagery resolution is 250 m, and the temporal resolution is daily.
