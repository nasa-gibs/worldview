### Black Marble Nighttime At Sensor Radiance (Day/Night Band)
Temporal coverage: 18 November 2020 - present

The Black Marble Nighttime At Sensor Radiance (Day/Night Band) layer is created from NASA’s Black Marble daily at-sensor top-of-atmosphere nighttime radiance product (VNP46A1). It is displayed as a grayscale image. The layer is expressed in radiance units (nW/(cm<sup>2</sup> sr))  with log10 conversion. It is stretched up to 38 nW/(cm<sup>2</sup> sr) resulting in improvements in capturing city lights in greater spatial detail than traditional Nighttime Imagery resampled at 0-255 (e.g., Day/Night Band, Enhanced Near Constant Contrast).

The ultra-sensitivity of the VIIRS Day/Night Band enables scientists to capture the Earth’s surface and atmosphere in low light conditions, allowing for better monitoring of nighttime phenomena. These images are also useful for assessing anthropogenic sources of light emissions under varying illumination conditions. For instance, during partial to full moon conditions, the layer can identify the location and features of clouds and other natural terrestrial features such as sea ice and snow cover, while enabling temporal observations in urban regions, regardless of moonlit conditions. As such, the layer is particularly useful for detecting city lights, lightning, auroras, fires, gas flares, and fishing fleets.

The Black Marble Nighttime At Sensor Radiance (Day/Night Band) layer is available in near real-time from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) aboard the joint NASA/NOAA Suomi National Polar orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP) satellite. The sensor resolution is 750 m at nadir, imagery resolution is 500 m, and the temporal resolution is daily.

### Black Marble Nighttime Blue/Yellow Composite (Day/Night Band)
Temporal coverage: 30 April 2021 - present

The Black Marble Nighttime Blue/Yellow Composite (Day/Night Band) is a false color composite using the VIIRS at-sensor radiance and the brightness temperatures from the M15 band.  Data are provided by NASA’s VNP46A1 product using Suomi NPP observations. Originally designed by the Naval Research Lab and incorporated into NASA research and applications efforts, the resulting false color scheme produces nighttime city lights in shades of yellow with infrared, nighttime cloud presence in shades of blue. During bright moonlight conditions, moonlight reflected from cloud tops and the land surface may also provide a yellow hue to those features. Comparisons of cloud-free conditions before and after a period of significant change, such as new city growth, disasters, fires, or other factors, may exhibit a change in emitted light (yellows) from those features over time.

The Black Marble Nighttime Blue/Yellow Composite (Day/Night Band) layer is available in near real-time from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) aboard the joint NASA/NOAA Suomi National Polar orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP) satellite. The sensor resolution is 750 m at nadir, imagery resolution is 500 m, and the temporal resolution is daily.

### Nighttime Imagery (Day/Night Band, Enhanced Near Constant Contrast)
Temporal coverage: 3 December 2016 - present

**29 June 2020 Notice**: High latitude artifacts have been identified and fixed for 26 June 2020 onward. It is expected that the imagery will be reprocessed back to the beginning of the mission. [Read more about the issue](https://landweb.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/NPP_QA/displayCase.cgi?esdt=NPP_VDNE&caseNum=PM_NPP_VDNE_20178&caseLocation=cases_data&ver=C001).

The Nighttime Imagery (Day/Night Band, Enhanced Near Constant Contrast) layer shows the Earth’s surface and atmosphere using a sensor designed to capture low-light emission sources, under varying illumination conditions. It is displayed as a grayscale image. Sources of illumination include both natural and anthropogenic sources of light emissions. Lunar reflection can be used to highlight the location and features of clouds and other terrestrial features such as sea ice and snow cover when there is partial to full moon conditions. When there is no moonlight, natural and anthropogenic night time light emissions are highlighted such as city lights, lightning, upper-atmospheric gravity waves, auroras, fires, gas flares, and fishing fleets. This layer is useful for displaying cities and highways at night, the tracking of shipping and fishing fleets, as well as fires and the burning of waste natural gas (gas flares) from on and offshore oil/gas production sites.

The Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Nighttime Imagery (Day/Night Band, Enhanced Near Constant Contrast) layer is mainly a qualitative product and should be strictly used for image display purposes. Each VIIRS Level 1B scan (6-minutes in total length) is individually processed and normalized based on a static set of values that predict the viewing and illumination geometries of each pixel. Because of the confounding factors that influence a VIIRS scan from one night to the next (e.g., more/less cloudy days, with more/less moon illumination conditions), individual ENCC pixel-based values are not comparable over time. For accurate time-series detection (e.g., monitoring short-term increases or reductions in artificial lights at night), users are referred to NASA’s Black Marble standard product suite (VNP46A1/VNP46A2 for Suomi NPP). These standard products correct for short-term variations in lunar and environmental conditions. They also provide the necessary quality assurance (QA) flags and additional layers to identify and isolate potential sources of noise and measurement error (e.g., clouds, moon-light, and snow contaminated pixels) and variations (e.g. lunar and view angles and view time) in a statistically robust fashion.

The current ENCC Nighttime Imagery layer is available from the VIIRS instrument aboard the joint NASA/NOAA Suomi National Polar orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP) satellite at a daily temporal resolution. The VIIRS Day/Night Band (DNB) sensor resolution is 750 m at nadir and the ENCC imagery layer’s gridded resolution is 15 arc-second (approximately 500 meters at the equator).

### Black Marble
The Black Marble layer and the Black Marble – Nighttime Lights only layer is a nighttime view of the Earth, showing visible light emanating from anthropogenic sources such as city lights and other human-driven patterns. The Black Marble layer is an improvement over the "Earth At Night 2012: VIIRS City Lights 2012" layer, providing a look at anthropogenic light sources only, stripping out other nighttime light sources such as auroras, airglow and reflected moonlight from desert, snow, and other natural features. The layers are a composite of data from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) instrument on board the joint NASA/NOAA Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP) satellite. The image composite was assembled from clear, cloud free images for 2012 and 2016. The Black Marble layer is a base layer which includes the land masses, the Black Marble – Nighttime Lights only layer overlay only shows the nighttime lights.

Currently, the Black Marble imagery is available only as a single snapshot in time for 2012 and 2016. The sensor resolution is 750 m and the image resolution is 500 m. The imagery can be visualized in Worldview/Global Imagery Browse Services (GIBS).

### Earth at Night 2012: VIIRS City Lights 2012
The Earth at Night layer is a night time view of the Earth, showing visible light emanating from sources such as city lights, gas flares, wildfires, auroras and reflected moonlight. The image is a composite of data from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) instrument on board the joint NASA/NOAA Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP) satellite. The image composite was assembled from clear, cloud free images from 9 days in April 2012 and 13 days in October 2012.

The Earth at Night imagery is available only as a single snapshot in time. The sensor resolution is 750 m and the image resolution is 500 m. The imagery can be visualized in Worldview/Global Imagery Browse Services (GIBS). The imagery can be downloaded from [NASA Earth Observatory/Visible Earth](https://visibleearth.nasa.gov/view.php?id=79765).
