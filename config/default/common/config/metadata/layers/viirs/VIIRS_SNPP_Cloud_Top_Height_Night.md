The VIIRS Cloud Top Height (Night) layer indicates the geopotential height of the highest cloud top at a retrieved cloud top pressure (rounded to the nearest 50 m). Cloud Top Height helps in assessing the fraction of high Cirrus clouds present in the atmosphere. Cirrus clouds are crucially important to global radiative processes and the heat balance of the Earth as they allow solar heating of the Earth while reducing infrared radiation to space.

The VIIRS Cloud Top Height layer is available from the joint NASA/NOAA Suomi NPP satellite for nighttime overpasses. The sensor/algorithm resolution is 750 km, imagery resolution is 1 km, and the temporal resolution is daily.
