False Color: Red = Band M11, Green = Band M7, Blue = Band M5

This combination is most useful for distinguishing burn scars from naturally low vegetation or bare soil and enhancing floods. Vegetation will appear green and burned areas will appear reddish.

**Vegetation and bare ground**
Vegetation is very reflective in the near infrared (Band M7), and absorbent in Band M5 and Band M11. Assigning that band to green means even the smallest hint of vegetation will appear bright green in the image. Naturally bare soil, like a desert, is reflective in all bands used in this image, but more so in the SWIR (Band M11, red) and so soils will often have a pinkish tinge.

**Burned areas**
When vegetation burns, burned area or fire-affected areas become characterized by deposits of charcoal and ash, removal of vegetation and/or alteration of vegetation structure. When bare soil is exposed, the brightness in Band M5 usually slightly increases, but that may be offset by the presence of black carbon residue. The near infrared (Band M7) will become darker, and Band M11 becomes more reflective. When assigned to red in the image, Band M11 will show burn scars as deep or bright red, depending on the type of vegetation burned, the amount of residue, or the completeness of the burn.

**Water**
Liquid water on the ground will be very dark since it absorbs in the red and the SWIR. Sediments in water appear dark blue. Ice and snow appear as bright turquoise. Clouds comprised of small water droplets scatter light equally in both the visible and the SWIR and will appear white. These clouds are usually lower to the ground and warmer. High and cold clouds are comprised of ice crystals and will appear turquoise.

The Land Surface Reflectance product is available from both the joint NASA/NOAA Suomi NPP (VNP09GA) and NOAA-20 (VJ109GA) satellites. The sensor resolution is 750 m, the imagery resolution is 500 m, and the temporal resolution is daily.
