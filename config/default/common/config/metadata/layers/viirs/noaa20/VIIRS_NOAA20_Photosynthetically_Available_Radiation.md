The Photosynthetically Available Radiation (L2) layer displays photosynthetically available radiation over oceans and large bodies of water and is measured in einstein/m²/day.

Photosynthetically Available Radiation (PAR) controls the growth of aquatic plants and, therefore, regulates the composition of marine ecosystems.
