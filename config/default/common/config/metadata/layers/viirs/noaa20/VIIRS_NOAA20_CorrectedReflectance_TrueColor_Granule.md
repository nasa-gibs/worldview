**NOTE: This layer is undergoing beta testing. Imagery is pixelated in certain areas and is currently being investigated.**

Granule Corrected Reflectance imagery displays each 6-minute granule of imagery in near real-time. It is available on a 15 day rolling window basis. Each granule shows imagery as it was captured by the VIIRS instrument in that 6-minute time period and reveals areas that may have otherwise been obscured by the mosaicking of subsequent overpasses.

For a daily overview, please refer to the associated Corrected Reflectance Mosaic/Composite image.

True Color: Red = Band I1, Green = Band M4, Blue = Band M3

These images are called true-color or natural color because this combination of wavelengths is similar to what the human eye would see. The images are natural-looking images of land surface, oceanic and atmospheric features.

The Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Corrected Reflectance imagery is available only as near real-time imagery. The VIIRS instrument is aboard the joint NASA/NOAA NOAA-20 (JPSS-1) satellite. The imagery can be visualized in Worldview and the Global Imagery Browse Services (GIBS). The sensor resolution is 750 m and 375 m (M Bands are 750 m, I Bands are 375 m), imagery resolution is 250 m, and the temporal resolution is daily.

Note: The Corrected Reflectance and the Thermal Band I5 imagery from NOAA-20/VIIRS will occasionally show a checkered pattern, especially over the respective polar areas. This is due to overlapping and superimposition of observations from multiple orbits with widely different cloud/snow coverages. The checkered pattern may also arise from the mixture of partial day and night observations. Though all necessary steps have been taken to mitigate this effect, users may still notice this to some extent over the polar areas, depending on the season.
