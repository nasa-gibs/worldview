The Sea Surface Temperature (Day) layer displays level 2 11Âµm sea surface temperature in Celsius (C). The Visible and Infrared Imager/Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) is a multi-disciplinary instrument that is being flown on the Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS) series of spacecraft, including the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP) that launched in October 2011. JPSS is a multi-platform, multi-agency program that consolidates the polar orbiting spacecraft of NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). S-NPP is the initial spacecraft in this series, and VIIRS is the successor to MODIS for Earth science data product generation. VIIRS has 22 spectral bands ranging from 412 nm to 12 nm. There are 16 moderate-resolution bands (750m at nadir), 5 image-resolution bands (375m), and one day-night band (DNB).
