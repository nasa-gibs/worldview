The Sea Ice Surface Temperature (Day) layer shows the "skin" temperature of the sea ice surface measured in Kelvin (K). It is derived from radiance data acquired by the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) aboard the joint NASA/NOAA Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP) satellite. Following the approach used by MODIS, the algorithm converts VIIRS calibrated radiances into brightness temperature and computes Ice Surface Temperature (IST) using a split-window technique. Sea Ice Surface Temperature (IST) is an indicator of freeze/thaw processes on ice and has been used to separate thin ice from open water.

The Ice Surface Temperature product is available for the Suomi NPP (VNP29) and JPSS-1/NOAA-20 (VJ129) satellites. The sensor and imagery resolution is 750m, and the temporal resolution is daily.
