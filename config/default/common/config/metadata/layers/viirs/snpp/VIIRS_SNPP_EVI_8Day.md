The Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) is also used as a measure of the greenness and health of vegetation. It is calculated in a similar fashion as NDVI but it corrects for distortions caused by ground cover beneath the canopy vegetation and distortions in reflected light caused by particles in the air by using the blue band to remove residual atmosphere contamination caused by smoke and sub-pixel thin cirrus clouds. The EVI is more effective in areas with large amounts of chlorophyll such as rainforests. The index values range from -0.2 to 1 where higher values (0.3 to 1) indicate areas covered by green, leafy vegetation and lower values (0 to 0.3) indicate areas where there is little or no vegetation.

The VIIRS rolling 8-day EVI layer is available only as a near real-time, rolling 8-day product (VNP13A4N) from the joint NASA/NOAA Suomi National Polar orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP) satellite. The imagery resolution is 500m, and the temporal resolution is an 8-day product which is updated daily.
