False Color: Red = Band I1, Green = Band I2, Blue = Band I1

Vegetation is very reflective in the near infrared (Band I2), and absorbent in Band I1. Assigning Band I2 to green means even the smallest hint of vegetation will appear bright green in the image. Liquid water on the ground will be very dark since it absorbs in the red and the SWIR and sediments in water appear pink. This band combination is good for identifying vegetation changes, drought and floods.

The Land Surface Reflectance product is available from both the joint NASA/NOAA Suomi NPP (VNP09GA) and NOAA-20 (VJ109GA) satellites. The sensor resolution is 375 m, imagery resolution is 250 m, and the temporal resolution is daily.
