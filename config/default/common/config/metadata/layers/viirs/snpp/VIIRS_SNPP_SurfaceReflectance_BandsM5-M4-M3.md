True Color: Red = Band M5, Green = Band M4, Blue = Band M3

These images are called true-color or natural color because this combination of wavelengths is similar to what the human eye would see. The images are natural-looking images of land surface, oceanic and atmospheric features.

The Land Surface Reflectance product is available from both the joint NASA/NOAA Suomi NPP (VNP09GA) and NOAA-20 (VJ109GA) satellites. The sensor resolution is 750 m, the imagery resolution is 500 m, and the temporal resolution is daily.
