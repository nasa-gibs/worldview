### Clear Sky Confidence (Day | Night) - Suomi NPP
Temporal coverage: 1 March 2012 - Present

The Clear Sky Confidence product is the output of a cloud mask designed to work on multiple imaging sensors. Data values range from 0->1 and represent a confidence that clear skies were observed. A value of 1.0 means very high confidence of clear sky. A value of 0.0 means very low confidence of clear sky, or very high confidence that cloudy skies were observed. Confidences <= 0.95 are considered to be cloudy or partially cloudy; hence, when viewing this product we would recommend setting the threshold from 0 -> 0.95. By doing that and having the base layer set as the Corrected Reflectance one can see how effective the product is at masking out clouds.
