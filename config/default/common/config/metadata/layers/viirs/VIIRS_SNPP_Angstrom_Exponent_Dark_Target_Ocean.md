The VIIRS Dark Target Aerosol Angstrom Exponent layer can be used to provide additional information related to the aerosol particle size over the ocean (larger the exponent, the smaller the particle size). Values < 1 suggest optical dominance of coarse particles (e.g. dust) and values > 1 suggest optical dominance of fine particles (e.g. smoke).

This layer is created from two separate and distinct DT algorithms. One helps retrieve aerosol information over ocean (dark in visible and longer wavelengths), while the second aids retrievals over vegetated/dark-soiled land (dark in the visible).

The VIIRS Dark Target Aerosol Ångström Exponent layer is available from the joint NASA/NOAA Suomi National Polar orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP) satellite (`AERDT_L2_VIIRS_SNPP`) for the daytime overpass. The sensor/algorithm resolution is 6 km at nadir, imagery resolution is 2 km at nadir, and the temporal resolution is daily. Resolution is much coarser out toward the edge of the swath.
