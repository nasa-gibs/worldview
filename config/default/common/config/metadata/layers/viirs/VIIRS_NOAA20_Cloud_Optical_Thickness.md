The VIIRS Cloud Optical Thickness layer is a measure of the amount of sunlight affected by absorption and scattering when passing through the clouds. Clouds scatter and reflect most visible light.

The VIIRS Cloud Optical Thickness layer is available from the joint NASA/NOAA NOAA-20 satellite for daytime overpasses. The sensor/algorithm resolution is 750 m, imagery resolution is 1 km, and the temporal resolution is daily.
