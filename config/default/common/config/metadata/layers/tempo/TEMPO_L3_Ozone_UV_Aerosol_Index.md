The Tropospheric Emissions: Monitoring of Pollution (TEMPO) Level 3 (l3) ultraviolet (UV) Aerosol Index layer provides information on the UV aerosol index (a unitless quantity) using the difference between measured and theoretical radiance contrasts at two wavelengths (331.2 and 360 nm) from the total ozone retrieval algorithm. The retrieval is based on the Ozone Monitoring Instrument Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (OMI TOMS) V8.5 algorithm adapted for TEMPO.

Imagery is available as approximately one-hour scans for daylight hours over North America. The sensor’s native spatial resolution is ~2 km x 4.75 km at the center of TEMPO’s field of regard (FOR), the Level 3 product resolution is 0.02 x 0.02 degrees, and the imagery resolution is 2 km. The layer is filtered to display high-quality pixels with solar zenith angles less than 80 degrees.

Total ozone Level 3 files provide ozone and supporting information on a regular grid. Level 3 files are derived by combining information from all Level 2 files constituting a TEMPO East-West scan cycle, using an area-weighted re-gridding approach. The temporal resolution of a nominal scan is approximately one hour during daylight hours, with more frequent scans in the morning over the eastern portion of the FOR and in the evenings over the western portion of the FOR.
