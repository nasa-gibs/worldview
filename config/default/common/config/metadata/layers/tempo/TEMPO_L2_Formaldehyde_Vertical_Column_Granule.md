The Tropospheric Emissions: Monitoring of Pollution (TEMPO) Level 2 (L2) Formaldehyde Vertical Column layer provides information on the total amount of formaldehyde in a vertical column of the atmosphere. This is provided as the total number of formaldehyde molecules in a column of air above one square centimeter on the Earth’s surface (molecules/cm<sup>2</sup>).

Imagery is available as approximately six-minute granules for daylight hours over North America. The sensor’s native spatial resolution is ~2 km x 4.75 km at the center of TEMPO’s field of regard (FOR), and the imagery resolution is 1 km. The layer is filtered to display high-quality pixels using the main data quality flag, solar zenith angle, and effective cloud fraction variables.

Formaldehyde Level 2 files provide trace gas information at TEMPO’s native spatial resolution for individual granules. Each granule covers the entire North-South TEMPO FOR but only a portion of the East-West FOR. The temporal resolution of a nominal scan is approximately one hour during daylight hours, with more frequent scans in the morning over the eastern portion of the FOR and in the evenings over the western portion of the FOR.
