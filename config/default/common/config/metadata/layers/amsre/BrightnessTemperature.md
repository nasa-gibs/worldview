### AMSR-E Brightness Temperature (89H GHz | 89V GHz, B Scan, Day | Night)
Temporal coverage: 18 June 2002 - 4 October 2011

The Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer - Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) "Brightness Temperature" layers display brightness temperatures (TBs) in kelvins for the 89 GHz horizontal (H) and vertical (V) polarizations for the 1:30 a.m. ascending (day) and the 1:30 p.m. descending (night) half-orbit passes of the AMSR-E radiometer B feedhorn. Brightness temperature is the product of a body's physical temperature multiplied by its emissivity at a given wavelength. The 89 GHz TBs are provided in their native resolution of 5.4 km.  The AMSR-E TB product also contains 89 GHz TBs resampled to the coarser resolutions of the other AMSR-E channels.

On board NASA's Aqua satellite, the AMSR-E radiometer measured terrestrial, oceanic, and atmospheric variables used to investigate global water and energy cycles. The imagery resolution is 2 km and sensor resolution is 5.4 km. The temporal resolution was daily.
