### AMSR-E Sea Ice Concentration, 12 km
Temporal coverage: 18 June 2002 - 4 October 2011

The Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer - Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) "Sea Ice Concentration, 12 km" layers displays the percent of sea ice concentration in the Polar regions as a daily composite of the 1:30 a.m. ascending and 1:30 p.m. descending half-orbit passes of the AMSR-E B feedhorn at a 12.5 km resolution.

Sea ice concentration describes the relative amount of area covered by ice, compared to some reference area and usually reported as a percentage. In this case, the relative area is a 12.5 km x 12.5 km swath.

Onboard NASA's Aqua satellite, the AMSR-E radiometer measured terrestrial, oceanic, and atmospheric parameters used to investigate global water and energy cycles. The imagery resolution is 2 km and sensor resolution is 12.5 km. The temporal resolution was daily.

### AMSR-E Sea Ice Concentration, 25 km
Temporal coverage: 18 June 2002 - 4 October 2011

The Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer - Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) "Sea Ice Concentration, 25 km" layer displays the percent of sea ice concentration in the Polar regions as a daily composite of the 1:30 a.m. ascending and 1:30 p.m. descending half-orbit passes of the AMSR-E B feedhorn at a 25 km resolution.

Sea ice concentration describes the relative amount of area covered by ice, compared to some reference area and usually reported as a percentage. In this case, the relative area is 25 km x 25 km swath.

Onboard NASA's Aqua satellite, the AMSR-E radiometer measured terrestrial, oceanic, and atmospheric parameters used to investigate global water and energy cycles. The imagery resolution is 2 km and sensor resolution is 25 km. The temporal resolution was daily.
