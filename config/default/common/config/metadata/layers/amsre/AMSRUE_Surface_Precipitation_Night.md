The Surface Precipitation Rate (Night) layer displays instantaneous total precipitation (solid and liquid) rate in millimeters per hour (mm/hr) at the surface.

Surface precipitation rate is derived from brightness temperatures by modeling the absorption and scattering effects of precipitation on microwave emissions for specified cloud temperatures, water vapor, and hydro meteor profiles. Ice and snow are efficient scatterers of microwave radiation compared with rain.

The data are derived by applying the AMSR-E/AMSR2 unified algorithm to L1R data obtained by the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR) for EOS (AMSR-E) and AMSR2 instruments.

The imagery resolution is 2 km and sensor resolution is 10 km along track x 5 km along scan. The temporal resolution was daily.
