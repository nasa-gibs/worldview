The AMSR-UE Sea Ice Concentration, 25 km layer displays the percent of sea ice concentration in the Polar regions at a 25 km resolution.

Sea ice concentration describes the relative amount of area covered by ice, compared to some reference area and usually reported as a percentage. In this case, the relative area is 25 km x 25 km swath.

The data are derived from observations acquired by the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR) for EOS (AMSR-E) and AMSR2 instruments that have been spatially resampled by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) to unify the AMSR-E and AMSR2 missions. Sea ice concentrations are generated with the Enhanced NASA Team (NT2) algorithm.

The imagery resolution is 2 km in the Geographic projection and 1 km in the Arctic and Antarctic projections, and the sensor resolution is 25 km. The temporal resolution was daily.
