The Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer - Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) "Surface Precipitation Rate (Day)" layer displays instantaneous total precipitation (solid and liquid) rate in millimeters per hour (mm/hr) at the surface for the 1:30 a.m. ascending (day) half-orbit passes of the AMSR-E B feedhorn.

Surface precipitation rate is derived from brightness temperatures by modeling the absorption and scattering effects of precipitation on microwave emissions for specified cloud temperatures, water vapor, and hydro meteor profiles. Ice and snow are efficient scatterers of microwave radiation compared with rain.

Onboard NASA's Aqua satellite, the AMSR-E radiometer measured terrestrial, oceanic, and atmospheric parameters used to investigate global water and energy cycles. The imagery resolution is 2 km and sensor resolution is 10 km along track x 5 km along scan. The temporal resolution was daily.
