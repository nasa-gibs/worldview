The Total Precipitable Water (Night) layer displays the integrated water vapor in units of millimeters (mm) in the atmospheric column.

The data are derived from AMSR-E and AMSR2 brightness temperature observations that have been resampled by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) to facilitate an intercalibrated (i.e., “unified”) AMSR-E/AMSR2 data record.

The imagery resolution is 2 km and sensor resolution is 10 km along track x 5 km along scan. The temporal resolution was daily.
