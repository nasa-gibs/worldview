The Soil Moisture (Single Channel Algorithm, Night) layer displays gridded estimates of soil moisture in the top 1 cm of soil, averaged over the AMSR-E retrieval footprint, and is measured in grams per centimeter by volume (g/cm<sup3</sup>) Soil moisture is estimated from AMSR-E/Aqua L2A brightness temperature (Tb) measurements using the Single Channel Algorithm (SCA) approach.
