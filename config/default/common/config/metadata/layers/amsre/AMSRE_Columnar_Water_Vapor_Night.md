The Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer - Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) "Columnar Water Vapor (Night)" layer displays integrated water vapor in the atmospheric water column - synonymous with Total Precipitable Water (TPW) stored in the ocean parameters, and is measured in millimeters (mm).

Onboard NASA's Aqua satellite, the AMSR-E radiometer measured terrestrial, oceanic, and atmospheric parameters used to investigate global water and energy cycles. The imagery resolution is 2 km and sensor resolution is 10 km along track x 5 km along scan. The temporal resolution was daily.

Data field: `TotalColWaterVapor`
