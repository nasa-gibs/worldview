The Cloud Liquid Water Patj (Day) layer is a measure of the integrated liquid water, as in clouds or rain, in the atmospheric column in units of grams per square meter (g/m<sup>2</sup>).

The data are derived from AMSR-E and AMSR2 brightness temperature observations that have been resampled by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) to facilitate an intercalibrated (i.e., “unified”) AMSR-E/AMSR2 data record.

The imagery resolution is 2 km and sensor resolution is 10 km along track x 5 km along scan. The temporal resolution was daily.
