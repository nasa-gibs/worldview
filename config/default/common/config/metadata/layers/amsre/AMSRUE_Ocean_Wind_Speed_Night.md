The Ocean Wind Speed (Night) layer shows wind speed over oceans at 10m altitude in units of meters per second (m/s).

The data are derived from AMSR-E and AMSR2 brightness temperature observations that have been resampled by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) to facilitate an intercalibrated (i.e., “unified”) AMSR-E/AMSR2 data record.
