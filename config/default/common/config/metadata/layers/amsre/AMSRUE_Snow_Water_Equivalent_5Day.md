The Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-E/Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-2 (AMSR-E/AMSR2) “Snow Water Equivalent” (SWE) layer displays 5-day maximum SWE estimates in millimeters (mm) for the Northern Hemisphere rendered to an azimuthal 25 km Equal-Area Scalable Earth Grid (EASE-Grid). SWE indicates the quantity of water that is contained in snowpack and is fundamental for water resources management, weather forecasting, flash flood prediction and the study of water and energy cycles.

The data are derived from observations acquired by the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR) for EOS (AMSR-E) and AMSR2 instruments that have been spatially resampled by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) to unify the AMSR-E and AMSR2 missions.
