The Columnar Water Vapor (Night) layer displays integrated water vapor in the atmospheric water column - synonymous with Total Precipitable Water (TPW) stored in the ocean parameters, and is measured in millimeters (mm).

The data are derived by applying the AMSR-E/AMSR2 unified algorithm to L1R data obtained by the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR) for EOS (AMSR-E) and AMSR2 instruments.

The imagery resolution is 2 km and sensor resolution is 10 km along track x 5 km along scan. The temporal resolution was daily.

Data field: `TotalColWaterVapor`
