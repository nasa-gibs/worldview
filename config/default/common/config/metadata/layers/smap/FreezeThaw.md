### Freeze/Thaw 36 km (L3, Passive)
Temporal coverage: 31 March 2015 - present

The Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) “Freeze/Thaw 36 km (L3, Passive)” layer displays freeze/thaw state posted on a 36 km EASE-Grid 2.0 for Global land suface areas and land surface areas north of 45°N latitude from the SMAP radiometer. Freeze/thaw is detected by identifying the temporal response of the normalized polarization ratio (NPR) of the brightness temperature, which is sensitive to changes in the dielectric constant of the landscape components that occur as the water within the components transitions between frozen and non-frozen conditions.

The SMAP spacecraft carries two instruments, a radar (active) and a radiometer (passive), that together make global measurements of land surface soil moisture and freeze/thaw state. It is useful for monitoring and predicting natural hazards such as floods and droughts, understanding the linkages between Earth’s water, energy and carbon cycles, and reducing uncertainties in predicting weather and climate.

### Freeze/Thaw 9 km (L3, Passive)
Temporal coverage: 31 March 2015 - present

The Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) “Freeze/Thaw 9 km (L3, Passive)” layer displays freeze/thaw state for Global land surface areas and land surface areas north of 45°N latitude from the SMAP radiometer. To enhance the grid resolution, Backus-Gilbert optimal interpolation techniques are used to extract maximum information from SMAP antenna temperatures and convert them to brightness temperatures, which are posted to the 9 km EASE-Grid 2.0. Freeze/thaw is detected by identifying the temporal response of the normalized polarization ratio (NPR) of the brightness temperature, which is sensitive to changes in the dielectric constant of the landscape components that occur as the water within the components transitions between frozen and non-frozen conditions.

### Freeze/Thaw 3 km (L3, Active)
Temporal coverage: 13 April 2015 - 7 July 2015

The Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) “Freeze/Thaw 3 km (L3, Active)” layer displays freeze/thaw state posted on a 3 km EASE-Grid 2.0 for land surface areas north of 45°N latitude from the SMAP radar. Freeze/thaw is detected by identifying the temporal response of radar backscatter to changes in the dielectric constant of the landscape components that occur as the water within the components transitions between frozen and non-frozen conditions.
