The Aqua Orbital Track & Overpass Time (Descending/Night) layer is the path of the Aqua satellite on its descending/night-time orbit. Overpass times are shown in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).  Local overpass time at the equator has drifted to ~00:30 as the satellite has reached end-of-life and is continuing to drift.
