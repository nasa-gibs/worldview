The Sentinel-1B Orbital Track & Overpass Time (Ascending/Night) layer is the path of the Sentinel-1B satellite on its ascending/night-time orbit. Overpass times are shown in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

The Sentinel-1 mission is a constellation of two polar-orbiting satellites, Sentinel-1A and Sentinel-1B, which share the same orbital plane. They operate day and night performing C-band synthetic aperture radar imaging enabling them to acquire regardless of weather. The C-band synthetic aperture radar instrument has a right-looking active phased array antenna which operates in four acquisition modes: Strip Map, Interferometric Wide Swath, Extra-Wide Swath, and Wave Mode. This means that these orbit tracks reflect the path of the satellite and not the location of the data swaths, as those are collected off nadir, to the right of the satellite.
