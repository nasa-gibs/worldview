The Terra Orbital Track & Overpass Time (Descending/Day) layer is the path of the Terra satellite on its descending/day-time orbit. Overpass times are shown in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). Local overpass time at the equator has drifted to ~09:30 as the satellite has reached end-of-life and is continuing to drift.
