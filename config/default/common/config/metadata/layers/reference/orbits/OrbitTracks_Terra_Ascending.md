The Terra Orbital Track & Overpass Time (Ascending/Night) layer is the path of the Terra satellite on its ascending/night-time orbit. Overpass times are shown in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).  Local overpass time at the equator has drifted to ~21:30 as the satellite has reached end-of-life and is continuing to drift.
