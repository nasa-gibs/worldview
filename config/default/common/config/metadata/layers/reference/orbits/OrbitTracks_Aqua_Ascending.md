The Aqua - Orbit Track & Time (Ascending/Day) layer is the path of the Aqua satellite on its ascending/day-time orbit. Overpass times are shown in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). Local overpass time at the equator has drifted to ~14:30 as the satellite has reached end-of-life and is continuing to drift.
