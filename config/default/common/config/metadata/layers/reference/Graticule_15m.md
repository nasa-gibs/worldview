The Latitude-Longitude Lines layer is a vector layer displaying the grid/graticule of latitude and longitude lines over the globe.

In the geographic projection, Latitude-Longitude Lines were generated from Shapefiles provided by [Natural Earth](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/). For the Arctic and Antarctic polar stereographic projections, the graticule layers were generated from [Polarview](https://www.polarview.aq/).
