The Place Labels layer is a reference layer that displays labels for countries, states, major cities, minor cities, towns, airports, large water bodies and major national parks/protected areas.

Place Labels information are gleaned from [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright) and [Natural Earth](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/).
