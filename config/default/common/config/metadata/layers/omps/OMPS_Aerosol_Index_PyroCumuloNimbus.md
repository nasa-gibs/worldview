The OMPS Aerosol Index (PyroCumuloNimbus) layer indicates the presence of ultraviolet (UV)-absorbing particles in the air (aerosols) such as desert dust and soot particles in the atmosphere; it is related to both the thickness of the aerosol layer located in the atmosphere and to the height of the layer. The Aerosol Index (PyroCumuloNimbus) layer is useful for identifying and tracking the extent and spread of pyrocumulonimbus and other high-aerosol events in the atmosphere. The layer has a unitless range from < 0 to >= 50. It differs from the Aerosol Index layer which detects aerosol index values between 0 and 5, because in the case of pyrocumulonimbus events, which are both dense and high in the atmosphere, the aerosol index value can easily become much larger than 5. Larger aerosol index values between 5 and 10 usually indicate dense smoke from intensely burning fires that reach higher in the troposphere, and once the aerosol index value is above 10, the smoke has likely been produced from a pyrocumulonimbus event, with dense smoke lofted into the upper troposphere, and often, into the stratosphere.

The OMPS Aerosol Index (PyroCumuloNimbus) layer is a science parameter of the Ozone Mapping and Profiler Suite (OMPS)/ National Polar orbiting Partnership (NPP) (OMPS-NPP) L2 NM Aerosol Index swath orbital V2 (OMPS_NPP_NMMIEAI_L2) available from the OMPS Nadir-Mapper instrument on the Suomi National Polar orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP) satellite. The aerosol index is derived from normalized radiances using 2 wavelength pairs at 340 and 378.5 nm. The sensor resolution is 50 km, imagery resolution is 2 km, and the temporal resolution is daily.
