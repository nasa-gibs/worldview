The OMPS Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) Planetary Boundary Layer (PBL) indicates the column density of sulfur dioxide in the tropospheric boundary-layer (corresponding to the center of mass altitude (CMA) of 0.9 km) and is measured in Dobson Units (DU). The planetary boundary layer is often used in studies on near-surface pollution.

The OMPS Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) Planetary Boundary Layer is a science parameter of the Ozone Mapping and Profiler Suite (OMPS)-N20 NM PCA Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) Step 1 Total Column 1-Orbit L2 Swath 17x13km collection 1 product. It is available from the OMPS Nadir-Mapper (NM) sensor on the joint NASA/NOAA NOAA-20 (JPSS-1) satellite. The sensor resolution is 25 km, imagery resolution is 2 km, and the temporal resolution is daily.
