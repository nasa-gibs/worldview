The Aerosol Index at 360nm layer indicates the presence of ultraviolet (UV)-absorbing particles in the air (aerosols) such as desert dust, volcanic ash, and smoke particles in the atmosphere; it is related to both the thickness of the aerosol layer located in the atmosphere and to the height of the layer.

The Aerosol Index (AI) at 360 nm is similar to the AI at 380 nm but uses the 331 / 360 nm wavelength pair. It provides a link to the AI determined from the heritage AI products provided by the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) instruments as well as to the current AI products from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) and the Tropospheric Emissions: Monitoring of Pollution (TEMPO) instrument.

The Aerosol Index is a unitless value that typically ranges from 0 to 5, with higher values indicating heavier concentrations that could reduce visibility or impact human health such as dust storms or biomass burning smoke located in the lower troposphere (1-3 km).

The layer is useful for identifying and tracking the long-range transport of volcanic ash from volcanic eruptions, smoke from wildfires or biomass burning events and dust from desert dust storms, even tracking over clouds and areas of snow and ice. Larger aerosol index values between 5 and 10 usually indicate dense smoke from intensely burning fires that reach higher in the troposphere. An AI value above 10 usually indicates aerosols produced by an extreme event, such as smoke from a pyroCb cloud or ash from a volcanic eruption; both types of events can loft such aerosols into the upper troposphere and, often, into the stratosphere. For AI values higher than 5, use the corresponding Aerosol Index (PyroCumuloNimbus) at 360nm layer.

The Aerosol Index layer at 360nm is a science parameter of the Ozone Mapping and Profiler Suite (OMPS)-N20 L2 NM Aerosol Index swath orbital NRT (OMPS_N20_NMUVAI_L2_NRT) available from the OMPS Nadir-Mapper instrument on the NOAA-20 satellite. The aerosol index is derived from sun-normalized radiances (S-NRs) measured at 331 and 360 nm. It is essentially the difference between the measured S-NR at 360 nm and one calculated using a reflectivity determined from the 331 nm wavelength while assuming an atmosphere free of smoke, ash, or dust.  The sensor resolution is, at nadir, approximately 12 km cross-track by 17 km along-track; the temporal resolution is daily.
