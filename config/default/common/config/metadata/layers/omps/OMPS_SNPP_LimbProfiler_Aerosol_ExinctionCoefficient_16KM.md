The OMPS Aerosol Extinction Vertical Profile (15.5 - 16.5 km) layer indicates the average retrieved aerosol extinction coefficient at altitudes of 15.5 - 16.5 km above the tropopause in km-1 (or 1/km),as  measured by the Limb Profiler (LP) sensor on the joint NASA/NOAA Suomi NPP satellite. The assumed tropopause height comes from the Goddard Earth Observing System Forward Processing for Instrument Teams (GEOS FP-IT) data product.
The OMPS Aerosol Extinction Vertical Profile (15.5 - 16.5 km) layer is a science parameter of the OMPS-Suomi NPP LP Near-real-time (NRT) Aerosol Extinction Vertical Profile swath multi-wavelength orbital 3slit product.

It is available from the OMPS Limb Profiler (LP) sensor on the joint NASA/NOAA Suomi National Polar orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP) satellite. Spatial coverage is global (-90 to 90 degrees latitude), and there are about 14.5 orbits per day each measuring three limb profiles spaced approximately 250 km in the cross-track direction. The profiles are measured from the ground up to about 80 km with a vertical resolution of the retrieved profiles of approximately 1.8 km. The temporal resolution is daily.
