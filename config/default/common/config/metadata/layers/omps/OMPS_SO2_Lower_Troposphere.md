The OMPS Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) Lower Troposphere layer indicates the column density of sulfur dioxide in the lower troposphere (corresponding to 2.5 km center of mass altitude (CMA)) and is measured in Dobson Units (DU). The lower troposphere layer can be used to study degassing from volcanic sources.

The OMPS Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) Lower Troposphere layer is a science parameter of the Ozone Mapping and Profiler Suite (OMPS)-NPP L2 NM Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) Total and Tropospheric Column swath orbital collection 2 version 2.0 product. It is available from the OMPS Nadir-Mapper (NM) sensor on the joint NASA/NOAA Suomi-National Polar orbiting Partnership (Suomi-NPP) satellite. The sensor resolution is 25 km, imagery resolution is 2 km, and the temporal resolution is daily.
