The OMPS Aerosol Extinction Vertical Profile (Aerosol height) layer indicates the retrieved enhanced aerosol height in kilometers (km), as measured by the Limb Profiler (LP) sensor on the joint NASA/NOAA Suomi NPP satellite. The aerosol height is located at least 1.5 km above the tropopause. The tropopause height is derived from the Goddard Earth Observing System Forward Processing for Instrument Teams (GEOS FP-IT) data product.

The OMPS Aerosol Extinction Vertical Profile (Height) layer is a science parameter of the OMPS-Suomi NPP LP Near-real-time (NRT) Aerosol Extinction Vertical Profile swath multi-wavelength orbital 3slit product.

It is available from the OMPS Limb Profiler (LP) sensor on the joint NASA/NOAA Suomi National Polar orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP) satellite. Spatial coverage is global (-90 to 90 degrees latitude), and there are about 14.5 orbits per day each measuring three limb profiles spaced approximately 250 km in the cross-track direction. The profiles are measured from the ground up to about 80 km with a vertical resolution of the retrieved profiles of approximately 1.8 km. The temporal resolution is daily.
