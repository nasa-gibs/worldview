The OMPS Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) Planetary Boundary Layer (PBL) indicates the column density of sulfur dioxide in the tropospheric boundary-layer (corresponding to the center of mass altitude (CMA) of 0.9 km) and is measured in Dobson Units (DU). The planetary boundary layer is often used in studies on near-surface pollution.

The OMPS Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) Planetary Boundary Layer is a science parameter of the Ozone Mapping and Profiler Suite (OMPS)-NPP L2 NM Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) Total and Tropospheric Column swath orbital collection 2 version 2.0 product. It is available from the OMPS Nadir-Mapper (NM) sensor on the joint NASA/NOAA Suomi-National Polar orbiting Partnership (Suomi-NPP) satellite. The sensor resolution is 25 km, imagery resolution is 2 km, and the temporal resolution is daily.
