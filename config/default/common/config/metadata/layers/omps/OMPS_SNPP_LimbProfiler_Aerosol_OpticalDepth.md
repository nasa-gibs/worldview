The OMPS Stratospheric Aerosol Optical Depth layer indicates the stratospheric aerosol optical depth as measured by the Limb Profiler (LP) sensor on the joint NASA/NOAA Suomi NPP satellite.

The OMPS Stratospheric Aerosol Optical Depth layer is a science parameter of the OMPS-Suomi NPP LP Near real-time (NRT) Aerosol Extinction Vertical Profile swath multi-wavelength orbital 3slit product and the OMPS-NPP L2 LP Aerosol Extinction Vertical Profile swath daily 3slit (AER) product.

It is available from the OMPS Limb Profiler (LP) sensor on the joint NASA/NOAA Suomi National Polar orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP) satellite. Spatial coverage is global (-90 to 90 degrees latitude), and there are about 14.5 orbits per day each measuring three limb profiles spaced approximately 250 km in the cross-track direction. The profiles are measured from the ground up to about 80 km with a vertical resolution of the retrieved profiles of approximately 1.8 km. The temporal resolution is daily.
