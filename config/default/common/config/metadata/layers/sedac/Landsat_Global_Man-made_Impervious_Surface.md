The Impervious Surface Percentage Layer is from the Global Man-made Impervious Surface (GMIS) Dataset From Landsat. It consists of global estimates of fractional impervious cover derived from the Global Land Survey (GLS) Landsat dataset for the target year 2010. The layer shows global percent of impervious cover at 30m spatial resolution. The spatial extent covers the entire globe except Antarctica and some small islands.

The dataset is expected to have a rather broad spectrum of users, from those wishing to examine/study the fine details of urban land cover over the globe at full 30m resolution to global modelers trying to understand the climate/environmental impacts of man-made surfaces at continental to global scales. For example, the data are applicable to local modeling studies of urban impacts on the energy, water, and carbon cycles, as well as analyses at the individual country level.
