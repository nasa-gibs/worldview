The Mammal Richness - Vulnerable Species layer is part of the Global Mammal Richness Grids data set. The 2015 Release of the Global Mammal Richness Grids data set of the Gridded Species Distribution collection are aggregations of the presence grids data for the entire class, individual families, and International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List status categories. The data are available in 30 arc-second (~1 km) resolutions. The grid cell values represent the number of species in a particular class, family or IUCN threatened category. The input vector layers are based on the IUCN Red List and the grids are compiled by the Columbia University Center for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN). The data from IUCN were downloaded in April 2013.

The purpose of the data set is to provide information on the number of mammal species present at a one-kilometer spatial resolution which can be used in modeling efforts, wildlife conservation planning, natural resource management, policy-making, biodiversity studies and human-environment interactions.
