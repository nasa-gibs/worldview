### Reservoirs
The Reservoirs vector layer indicates the location of reservoirs around the world. It is part of the Global Reservoir and Dam (GRanD) Database, Version 1.01. The Reservoirs layers has area of the reservoir as its only attribute.

The Global Reservoir and Dam (GRanD) Database, Version 1.01 contains 6,862 records of reservoirs and their associated dams with a cumulative storage capacity of 6,197 cubic km. The reservoirs were delineated from high spatial resolution satellite imagery. While the main focus was to include all reservoirs with a storage capacity of more than 0.1 cubic kilometers, many smaller reservoirs were added where data were available.
