### Reservoirs
The Reservoirs layer indicates the location of reservoirs around the world. It is part of the Global Reservoir and Dam (GRanD) Database, Version 1.01.

The Global Reservoir and Dam (GRanD) Database, Version 1.01 contains 6,862 records of reservoirs and their associated dams with a cumulative storage capacity of 6,197 cubic km. The reservoirs were delineated from high spatial resolution satellite imagery. While the main focus was to include all reservoirs with a storage capacity of more than 0.1 cubic kilometers, many smaller reservoirs were added where data were available.

The layer can be viewed in Worldview/Global Imagery Browse Services (GIBS) and the data can be downloaded from the [Socioeconomic Data and Applications Center (SEDAC)](http://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/data/set/grand-v1-reservoirs-rev01), which also provides the area of the reservoir.
