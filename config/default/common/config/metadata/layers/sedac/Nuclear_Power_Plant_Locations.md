The Nuclear Power Plants vector layer indicates the location of nuclear power plants across the world. It is part of the Population Exposure Estimates in Proximity to Nuclear Power Plants database, Version 1. The Nuclear Power Plants layer has attributes describing nuclear power plants and reactors including plant site name, Country, Number of Reactors, Population within 30 km, 75 km, and 150 km, Urban Population within 30 km, 75 km, and 150 km, Rural Population within 30 km, 75 km, and 150 km.

The nuclear power plants locations data set combines information from a global data set developed by Declan Butler of Nature News and the Power Reactor Information System (PRIS), an up-to-date database of nuclear reactors maintained by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The locations of nuclear reactors around the world are represented as point features associated with reactor specification and performance history attributes as of March 2012.
