### Ground Level Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2)
The Ground Level NO2, 1996 - 1998 and the Ground Level NO2, 2010 - 2012 layers are from the Global 3-Year Running Mean Ground-Level Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) Grids from GOME, SCIAMACHY and GOME-2. The Global 3-Year Running Mean Ground-Level Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) Grids from GOME, SCIAMACHY and GOME-2 represent a series of three-year running mean grids (1996-2012) of ground level NO2 that were derived from Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment (GOME), SCanning Imaging Absorption SpectroMeter for Atmospheric CHartographY (SCIAMACHY) and Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment-2 (GOME-2) satellite retrievals. For each satellite-derived NO2 source, the relationship between satellite observations of tropospheric NO2 column densities and the NO2 concentrations at ground level relevant to human exposure is simulated, using the Goddard Earth Observing System chemical transport model (GEOS-Chem) to produce a mean NO2 concentration raster grid. The grid cell resolution is six arc-minutes (0.1 degree, or approximately 10 km at the equator) covering the global land surface.

The purpose of the data set is to provide a continuous surface of NO2 concentrations for health and environmental research.
