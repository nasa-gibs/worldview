The Particulate Matter < 2.5Âµm, 2001-2010 layer is part of the Global Annual PM2.5 Grids from MODIS, MISR and SeaWiFS Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) data set represents a series of three-year running mean grids (1998-2012) of fine particulate matter (solid particles and liquid droplets) that were derived from a combination of MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer), MISR (Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer) and SeaWIFS (Sea-Viewing Wide Field-of-View Sensor) AOD satellite retrievals. Together the grids provide a continuous surface of concentrations in micrograms per cubic meter of particulate matter 2.5 micrometers or smaller (PM2.5) for health and environmental research. For each satellite-derived PM2.5 source, the total column retrievals of AOD were converted to near-ground PM2.5 levels using the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model to represent local relationships between AOD and PM2.5. A global decadal (2001-2010) mean PM2.5 concentration grid was also produced.
