### Dams
The Dams vector layer indicates the location of dams around the world. It is part of the Global Reservoir and Dam (GRanD) Database, Version 1.01. The layer displays the dams primary uses: Not classified, Fisheries, Flood Control, Hydroelectricity, Irrigation, Navigation, Other, Recreation and Water Supply. The Dams layer has multiple attributes, such as name of the dam and impounded river, primary use, nearest city, height, area and volume of reservoir, and year of construction (or commissioning).

The Global Reservoir and Dam Database, Version 1 (Revision 01) contains 6,862 records of reservoirs and their associated dams with a cumulative storage capacity of 6,197 cubic km. The dams were geospatially referenced and assigned to polygons depicting reservoir outlines at high spatial resolution. While the main focus was to include all dams associated with reservoirs that have a storage capacity of more than 0.1 cubic kilometers, many smaller dams and reservoirs were added where data were available.

The Reservoirs vector layer indicates the location of reservoirs around the world. It is part of the Global Reservoir and Dam (GRanD) Database, Version 1.01. The Reservoirs layers has area of the reservoir as its only attribute.

The Global Reservoir and Dam (GRanD) Database, Version 1.01 contains 6,862 records of reservoirs and their associated dams with a cumulative storage capacity of 6,197 cubic km. The reservoirs were delineated from high spatial resolution satellite imagery. While the main focus was to include all reservoirs with a storage capacity of more than 0.1 cubic kilometers, many smaller reservoirs were added where data were available.

### Human Built-up And Settlement Extent

The Human Built-up And Settlement Extent layer is from the Global Human Built-up And Settlement Extent (HBASE) Dataset from Landsat. It is a global map of HBASE derived from the Global Land Survey (GLS) Landsat dataset for the target year 2010. The layer is differentiated into three categories, "Not HBASE", "HBASE" and "Road". The spatial resolution is 30m. The spatial extent covers the entire globe except Antarctica and some small islands.

The dataset is expected to have a rather broad spectrum of users, from those wishing to examine/study the fine details of urban land cover over the globe at full 30m resolution to global modelers trying to understand the climate/environmental impacts of man-made surfaces at continental to global scales. For example, the data are applicable to local modeling studies of urban impacts on the energy, water, and carbon cycles, as well as analyses at the individual country level.

### Impervious Surface Percentage

The Impervious Surface Percentage Layer is from the Global Man-made Impervious Surface (GMIS) Dataset From Landsat. It consists of global estimates of fractional impervious cover derived from the Global Land Survey (GLS) Landsat dataset for the target year 2010. The layer shows global percent of impervious cover at 30m spatial resolution. The spatial extent covers the entire globe except Antarctica and some small islands.

The dataset is expected to have a rather broad spectrum of users, from those wishing to examine/study the fine details of urban land cover over the globe at full 30m resolution to global modelers trying to understand the climate/environmental impacts of man-made surfaces at continental to global scales. For example, the data are applicable to local modeling studies of urban impacts on the energy, water, and carbon cycles, as well as analyses at the individual country level.

### Population Density: 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015 and 2020 (GPWv4)
The Population Density layers are from the Gridded Population of the World, Version 4 (GPWv4) Population Count Adjusted to Match 2015 Revision of UN WPP Country Totals. It consists of estimates of human population consistent with national censuses and population registers with respect to relative spatial distribution, but adjusted to match 2015 Revision of UN World Population Prospects country totals for the years 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2020. A proportional allocation gridding algorithm, utilizing approximately 12.5 million national and sub-national administrative units, is used to assign population values to 30 arc-second (~1 km) grid cells. The grids contain estimates of the number of persons per grid cell.

The purpose of the data set is to provide estimates of population count for the years 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2020, consistent with national censuses and population registers with respect to relative spatial distribution, but adjusted to match United Nations country totals.

### Settlements
The Settlements vector layer indicates the locations of settlements around the world. It is part of the Global Rural-Urban Mapping Project, Version 1.01 (GRUMPv1): Settlement Points, Revision 01 and is an updated version of the Settlement Points, Version 1 (v1) used in the original population reallocation. Revision 01 includes improved geospatial location for selected settlements, as well as new georeferenced settlements. The Settlements layer includes attributes such as settlement name, population estimates per settlement for the year 2000, country, and whether the settlement is urban or rural.

The settlement points served as an input to the population gridding algorithm and the urban extents products of the Global Rural-Urban Mapping Project, Version 1.01 (GRUMPv1).

### Urban Extents
The Urban Extents layer indicates the extent of urban areas around the world for the year 1995 and is part of the Global Rural-Urban Mapping Project, Version 1 (GRUMPv1).

The Global Rural-Urban Mapping Project, Version 1 (GRUMPv1) urban extents grids distinguish urban and rural areas based on a combination of population counts (persons), settlement points, and the presence of Nighttime Lights. Areas are defined as urban where contiguous lighted cells from the Nighttime Lights or approximated urban extents based on buffered settlement points for which the total population is greater than 5,000 persons.

The layer can be viewed in Worldview/Global Imagery Browse Services (GIBS) and the data can be downloaded from the [Socioeconomic Data and Applications Center (SEDAC)](https://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/data/set/grump-v1-urban-extents).

### Urban-Rural Extents Below 10m Elevation
This layer provides the extent of urban and rural areas in the 10m Low Elevation Coastal Zone around the world. It is part of the Low Elevation Coastal Zone (LECZ) Urban-Rural Population and Land Area Estimates, Version 2 data set.

The Low Elevation Coastal Zone (LECZ) was derived from Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), 3 arc second (~90m) data which were post processed by ISciences LLC to include only elevations less than 20m contiguous to coastlines; and to supplement SRTM data in northern and southern latitudes.  The full data set includes population and land area statistics summarized at the low coastal elevations of less than or equal to 1m, 3m, 5m, 7m, 9m, 10m, 12m, and 20m. Additionally, estimates are provided for elevations > 20m, and nationally. Urban and rural areas are differentiated by the GRUMPv1 Urban Extents.

The layer can be viewed in Worldview/Global Imagery Browse Services (GIBS) and the data can be downloaded from the [Socioeconomic Data and Applications Center (SEDAC)](https://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/data/set/lecz-urban-rural-population-land-area-estimates-v2).

### Probabilities of Urban Expansion to 2030

The Global Grid of Probabilities of Urban Expansion to 2030 presents spatially explicit probabilistic forecasts of global urban land cover change from 2000 to 2030 at a 2.5 arc-minute resolution. For each grid cell that is non-urban in 2000, a Monte-Carlo model assigned a probability of becoming urban by the year 2030. The authors first extracted urban extent circa 2000 from the NASA MODIS Land Cover Type Product Version 5, which provides a conservative estimate of global urban land cover. The authors then used population densities from the Global Rural-Urban Mapping Project, Version 1 (GRUMPv1) to create the population density driver map. They estimated the amount of new urban land in each United Nations region by 2030 in a Monte-Carlo fashion based on present empirical distribution of regional urban population densities and probability density functions of projected regional population and GDP values for 2030. To facilitate integration with other data products, CIESIN reprojected the data from Goode's Homolosine to Geographic WGS84 projection.
