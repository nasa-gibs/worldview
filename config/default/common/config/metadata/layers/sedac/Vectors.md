### Dams
The Dams layer indicates the location of dams around the world. It is part of the Global Reservoir and Dam (GRanD) Database, Version 1.01. The layer displays the dams primary uses: Not classified, Fisheries, Flood Control, Hydroelectricity, Irrigation, Navigation, Other, Recreation and Water Supply. The Dams layer has multiple attributes, such as name of the dam and impounded river, primary use, nearest city, height, area and volume of reservoir, and year of construction (or commissioning). 

The Global Reservoir and Dam Database, Version 1 (Revision 01) contains 6,862 records of reservoirs and their associated dams with a cumulative storage capacity of 6,197 cubic km. The dams were geospatially referenced and assigned to polygons depicting reservoir outlines at high spatial resolution. While the main focus was to include all dams associated with reservoirs that have a storage capacity of more than 0.1 cubic kilometers, many smaller dams and reservoirs were added where data were available.

### Reservoirs
The Reservoirs layer indicates the location of reservoirs around the world. It is part of the Global Reservoir and Dam (GRanD) Database, Version 1.01. The Reservoirs layers has area of the reservoir as its only attribute.

The Global Reservoir and Dam (GRanD) Database, Version 1.01 contains 6,862 records of reservoirs and their associated dams with a cumulative storage capacity of 6,197 cubic km. The reservoirs were delineated from high spatial resolution satellite imagery. While the main focus was to include all reservoirs with a storage capacity of more than 0.1 cubic kilometers, many smaller reservoirs were added where data were available.

### Power Plants, Nuclear
The Nuclear Power Plants layer indicates the location of nuclear power plants across the world. It is part of the Population Exposure Estimates in Proximity to Nuclear Power Plants database, Version 1. The Nuclear Power Plants layer has attributes describing nuclear power plants and reactors including plant site name, Country, Number of Reactors, Population within 30 km, 75 km, and 150 km, Urban Population within 30 km, 75 km, and 150 km, Rural Population within 30 km, 75 km, and 150 km.

The nuclear power plants locations data set combines information from a global data set developed by Declan Butler of Nature News and the Power Reactor Information System (PRIS), an up-to-date database of nuclear reactors maintained by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The locations of nuclear reactors around the world are represented as point features associated with reactor specification and performance history attributes as of March 2012.
