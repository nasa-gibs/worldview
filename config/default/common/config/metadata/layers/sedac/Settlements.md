### Settlements
The Settlements layer indicates the locations of settlements around the world and is part of the Global Rural-Urban Mapping Project, Version 1 (GRUMPv1).

The settlement points served as an input to the population gridding algorithm and the urban extents products of the Global Rural-Urban Mapping Project, Version 1 (GRUMPv1).

The layer can be viewed in Worldview/Global Imagery Browse Services (GIBS) and the data can be downloaded from the [Socioeconomic Data and Applications Center (SEDAC)](http://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/data/set/grump-v1-settlement-points), along with population estimates per settlement.
