### Settlements
The Settlements layer indicates the locations of settlements around the world and is part of the Global Rural-Urban Mapping Project, Version 1.01 (GRUMPv1): Settlement Points, Revision 01 is an updated version of the Settlement Points, Version 1 (v1) used in the original population reallocation. Revision 01 includes improved geospatial location for selected settlements, as well as new georeferenced settlements.

The settlement points served as an input to the population gridding algorithm and the urban extents products of the Global Rural-Urban Mapping Project, Version 1.01 (GRUMPv1).

The layer can be viewed in Worldview/Global Imagery Browse Services (GIBS) and the data can be downloaded from the [Socioeconomic Data and Applications Center (SEDAC)](https://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/data/set/grump-v1-settlement-points), along with population estimates per settlement.
