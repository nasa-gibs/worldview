The OPERA Land Surface Disturbance (DIST-ALERT) Provisional imagery layer is a Level-3 (L3) product that maps per pixel vegetation disturbance (specifically, vegetation cover loss). Vegetation disturbance is mapped when there is an indicated decrease in vegetation cover within an HLS pixel. The spatial resolution is 30 m and the layer describes vegetation disturbance status through 4 major classifications: Provisional < 50%, Confirmed < 50%, Provisional >= 50%, Confirmed >= 50%, and No Data. The label “provisional” is used from the first detection until vegetation disturbance is detected for a consecutive number of HLS scenes when it is then labeled “confirmed”. These labels are reported for both above and below the 50% vegetation cover loss threshold. The input dataset for generating each product is the Harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2 (HLS) dataset. The OPERA Land Surface Disturbance Provisional (L3) imagery layer is available through the Observational Products for End-Users from Remote Sensing Analysis (OPERA) project.
