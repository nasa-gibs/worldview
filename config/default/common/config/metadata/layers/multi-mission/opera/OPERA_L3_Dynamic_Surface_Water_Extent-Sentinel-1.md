The OPERA Dynamic Surface Water Extent imagery layer is a Level-3 (L3) product that maps surface water every 6 - 12 days. The resolution is 30 m. Using Sentinel-1 radar observations, DSWx-S1 maps open inland water bodies greater than 3 hectares and 200 meters in width, irrespective of cloud conditions and daylight illumination that often pose challenges to optical sensors. The layer has 5 classifications: Not Water, Open Water, Inundated Vegetation, Height Above Nearest Drainage (HAND) masked, and Layover/Shadow masked.

The input dataset includes data from the C-SAR instrument aboard ESA's Sentinel-1A and Sentinel-1B satellites. The OPERA Dynamic Surface Water Extent (L3) imagery layer is available through the Observational Products for End-Users from Remote Sensing Analysis (OPERA) project.

The OPERA DSWx-S1 product contains modified Copernicus Sentinel data (2024-2025).
