The OPERA Dynamic Surface Water Extent imagery layer is a Level-3 (L3) product that maps surface water every few days. The resolution is 30 m and the layer has 5 classifications: Not Water, Open Water, Partial Surface Water, Snow/Ice, and Cloud/Cloud Shadow. The input dataset for generating each product is the Harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2 (HLS) dataset. The OPERA Dynamic Surface Water Extent (L3) imagery layer is available through the Observational Products for End-Users from Remote Sensing Analysis (OPERA) project.
