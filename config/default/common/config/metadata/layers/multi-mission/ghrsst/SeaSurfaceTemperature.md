### GHRSST Sea Surface Temperature
The Group for High Resolution Sea Surface Temperature (GHRSST) layers are the “skin sea surface temperature” at approximately 10-20 µm depth in Celsius (°C). Changes in sea surface temperature have an impact on weather, oceanic and atmospheric current patterns, affects ocean ecology and even life on land. Sea surface temperatures are normally warmer near the equator and cooler near the poles, but ocean currents move warm and cold water around the Earth’s oceans. When these currents flow near the surface, they are typically visible in the sea surface imagery if not obscured by clouds. El Niño is an example of how changes in sea surface temperature affect weather around the world. El Niño occurs every 3 – 7 years and causes a wide swath of the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean around the equator to warm 2 – 3 °C (or even more during intense El Nino events). This anomalous warming in turn changes weather  patterns around the world. For example, increased precipitation typically occurs in the southern United States, and severe drought is found in Australia, Indonesia, and southern Asia during these periods. Other examples of SST effects on weather include the ocean temperature influence on the development of tropical cyclones like hurricanes and typhoons. Tropical cyclones are dependent on warm SST from which they draw heat and energy to form and intensify.

### Sea Surface Temperature (L4, MUR)
Temporal coverage: 1 June 2002 - present

The GHRSST Sea Surface Temperature Level 4, MUR sea surface temperature analysis product uses wavelets as basis functions in an optimal interpolation approach on a global 0.011 degree grid. The version 4 Multiscale Ultrahigh Resolution (MUR) L4 analysis is based upon nighttime GHRSST L2P skin and subskin SST observations from several instruments including the NASA Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-EOS (AMSR-E), the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on the NASA Aqua and Terra platforms, the US Navy microwave WindSat radiometer and in situ SST observations from the NOAA iQuam project. The ice concentration data are from the archives at the EUMETSAT Ocean and Sea Ice Satellite Application Facility (OSI SAF) High Latitude Processing Center and are also used for an improved SST parameterization for the high-latitudes. The imagery resolution is 1 km, and the temporal resolution is daily.

### Sea Surface Temperature (L4, MUR25)
Temporal coverage: 1 September 2002 - present

The Sea Surface Temperature (L4, MUR25) layer is a Group for High Resolution Sea Surface Temperature (GHRSST) Level 4 sea surface temperature analysis. It is produced as a retrospective dataset (four day latency) and near-real-time dataset (one day latency) at the JPL Physical Oceanography DAAC using wavelets as basis functions in an optimal interpolation approach on a global 0.25 degree grid. The version 4 Multiscale Ultrahigh Resolution (MUR) L4 analysis is based upon nighttime GHRSST L2P skin and subskin SST observations from several instruments including the NASA Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-EOS (AMSR-E), the JAXA Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 on GCOM-W1, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometers (MODIS) on the NASA Aqua and Terra platforms, the US Navy microwave WindSat radiometer, the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) on several NOAA satellites, and in situ SST observations from the NOAA iQuam project. The ice concentration data are from the archives at the EUMETSAT Ocean and Sea Ice Satellite Application Facility (OSI SAF) High Latitude Processing Center and are also used for an improved SST parameterization for the high-latitudes. The dataset also contains an additional SST anomaly variable derived from a MUR climatology.

This dataset is funded by the [NASA MEaSUREs program](http://earthdata.nasa.gov/our-community/community-data-system-programs/measures-projects), and created by a team led by Dr. Toshio M. Chin from JPL. It adheres to the GHRSST Data Processing Specification (GDS) version 2 format specifications.

### Sea Surface Temperature (L4)
Temporal coverage: 1 September 1981 - Present

The Sea Surface Temperature (L4) layer is a Group for High Resolution Sea Surface Temperature (GHRSST) global Level 4 sea surface temperature analysis produced daily on a 0.25 degree grid at the NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information. This product uses optimal interpolation (OI) by interpolating and extrapolating SST observations from different sources, resulting in a smoothed complete field. The sources of data are satellite (AVHRR) and in situ platforms (i.e., ships and buoys), and the specific datasets employed may change. At the marginal ice zone, sea ice concentrations are used to generate proxy SSTs. Note that this is the AVHRR-ONLY (AVHRR-OI), available from September 1, 1981, but there is a companion SST product that includes microwave satellite data, available from June 2002.

### Sea Surface Temperature (L4, GAMSSA GDS2)
Temporal coverage: 23 July 2008 - present

The Sea Surface Temperature (GAMSSA GDS2) layer is a Group for High Resolution Sea Surface Temperature (GHRSST) Level 4 sea surface temperature analysis, produced daily on an operational basis at the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) using optimal interpolation (OI) on a global 0.25 degree grid. This Global Australian Multi-Sensor SST Analysis (GAMSSA) v1.0 system blends satellite SST observations from passive infrared and passive microwave radiometers with in situ data from ships, drifting buoys and moorings from the Global Telecommunications System (GTS). SST observations that have experienced recent surface wind speeds less than 6 m/s during the day or less than 2 m/s during night are rejected from the analysis.  The processing results in daily foundation SST estimates that are largely free of nocturnal cooling and diurnal warming effects.  Sea ice concentrations are supplied by the NOAA/NCEP 12.7 km sea ice analysis.  In the absence of observations, the analysis relaxes to the Reynolds and Smith (1994) Monthly 1 degree SST climatology for 1961 - 1990.
