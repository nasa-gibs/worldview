The dynamically generated Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI) (B3-B6)/(B3+B6) imagery layer is an index for quantifying snow cover. It can also be used to differentiate snow from cloud cover because while snow absorbs in the shortwave infrared light, it reflects the visible light, and cloud is generally reflective in both wavelengths. Snow cover is shown in dark blues.

It is calculated using:

`NDSI = (B3-B6)/(B3+B6)`

The Reflectance imagery layer from Landsat 8 and 9/OLI product (L30) is available through the HLS project from the Operational Land Imager (OLI) aboard the Landsat 8 and 9 satellites. The sensor resolution is 30 m, imagery resolution is 30 m, and the temporal resolution is daily with an 8 day revisit time. The imagery is available in Worldview/GIBS approximately 2 - 4 days after satellite overpass. There is a separate combined Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B imagery layer available.

Landsat 9 launched on September 21, 2021 and was subsequently added to the HLS product, availability of imagery from Landsat 8 and Landsat 9 is as follows:
- Landsat 8: April 11, 2013 - Present
- Landsat 9: May 31, 2022 - Present

This imagery layer is provided dynamically through the [NASA Interagency Implementation and Advanced Concepts Team (IMPACT)](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/about/impact). As it is dynamically generated, it may take slightly longer to display than normal. The imagery is only available at higher zoom levels.
