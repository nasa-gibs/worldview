The dynamically generated Reflectance (Bands 7-6-4, Urban False Color) imagery layer is useful for visualizing urban areas more clearly. Urban areas are white, grey, or purple and vegetation appear in shades of green. Snow and ice are dark blue, and water is black or blue. Flooded areas are very dark blue, sometimes black. Wildfires and lava in calderas of volcanoes display in shades of yellow and red.

The Reflectance imagery layer from Landsat 8 and 9/OLI product (L30) is available through the HLS project from the Operational Land Imager (OLI) aboard the Landsat 8 and 9 satellites. The sensor resolution is 30 m, imagery resolution is 30 m, and the temporal resolution is daily with an 8 day revisit time. The imagery is available in Worldview/GIBS approximately 2 - 4 days after satellite overpass. There is a separate combined Sentinel-2 imagery layer available.

Landsat 9 launched on September 27, 2021 and was subsequently added to the HLS product, availability of imagery from Landsat 8 and Landsat 9 is as follows:
- Landsat 8: April 11, 2013 - Present
- Landsat 9: May 31, 2022 - Present

This imagery layer is provided dynamically through the [NASA Interagency Implementation and Advanced Concepts Team (IMPACT)](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/about/impact). As it is dynamically generated, it may take slightly longer to display than normal. The imagery is only available at higher zoom levels.
