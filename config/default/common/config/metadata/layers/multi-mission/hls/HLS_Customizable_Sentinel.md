**NOTE: This layer is undergoing beta testing.**

This Reflectance imagery layer can be customized to display any available Red-Green-Blue (R-G-B) band combination. Select the desired combination in via the Options panel. The layer is dynamically generated, therefore it may take longer to display.

The Reflectance imagery layer from Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B/MSI product (S30) is available through the HLS project from the Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) aboard the European Union’s Copernicus Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B satellites. The sensor resolution is 10, 20, and 60 m, imagery resolution is resampled to 30 m, and the temporal resolution is daily with a 5 day revisit time. The imagery is available in Worldview/GIBS approximately 2 - 4 days after satellite overpass. There is a separate combined Landsat 8 and 9 imagery layer available.

On January 21, 2025, the Sentinel-2A satellite was replaced with the Sentinel-2C satellite. Therefore, this layer contains a mix of imagery from Sentinel-2A, Sentinel-2B, and Sentinel-2C.

- Sentinel-2A: November 28, 2015 to January 22, 2025
- Sentinel-2B: September 18, 2017 to Present
- Sentinel-2C: January 21, 2025 to Present

This imagery layer is provided dynamically through the [NASA Interagency Implementation and Advanced Concepts Team (IMPACT)](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/about/impact). As it is dynamically generated, it may take slightly longer to display than normal. The imagery is also only available at higher zoom levels.
