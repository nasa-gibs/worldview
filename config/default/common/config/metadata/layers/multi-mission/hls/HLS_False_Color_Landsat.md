**NOTE: This layer is undergoing beta testing.**

The dynamically generated Reflectance (Bands 5-4-3, Color Infrared) imagery layer is a false color composite that is used to gauge plant health and assess plant density. Plants reflect in near infrared and green light, while absorbing in red. Areas with better vegetation health appear red, and denser plant growth is a darker red. Cities, urban areas, and exposed ground appear grey or tan and water is blue or black.

The Reflectance imagery layer from Landsat 8 and 9/OLI product (L30) is available through the HLS project from the Operational Land Imager (OLI) aboard the Landsat 8 and 9 satellites. The sensor resolution is 30 m, imagery resolution is 30 m, and the temporal resolution is daily with an 8 day revisit time. The imagery is available in Worldview/GIBS approximately 2 - 4 days after satellite overpass. There is a separate combined Sentinel-2 imagery layer available.

Landsat 9 launched on September 27, 2021 and was subsequently added to the HLS product, availability of imagery from Landsat 8 and Landsat 9 is as follows:
- Landsat 8: April 11, 2013 - Present
- Landsat 9: May 31, 2022 - Present

This imagery layer is provided dynamically through the [NASA Interagency Implementation and Advanced Concepts Team (IMPACT)](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/about/impact). As it is dynamically generated, it may take slightly longer to display than normal. The imagery is only available at higher zoom levels.
