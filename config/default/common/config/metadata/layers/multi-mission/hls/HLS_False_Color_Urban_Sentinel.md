The dynamically generated Reflectance (Bands 12-11-4, Urban False Color) imagery layer is useful for visualizing urban areas more clearly. Urban areas are white, grey, or purple and vegetation appear in shades of green. Snow and ice are dark blue, and water is black or blue. Flooded areas are very dark blue, sometimes black. Wildfires and lava in calderas of volcanoes display in shades of yellow and red.


The Reflectance imagery layer from Sentinel 2A and 2B/MSI product (S30) is available through the HLS project from the Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) aboard the European Unionâ€™s Copernicus Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B satellites. The sensor resolution is 10, 20, and 60 m, imagery resolution is resampled to 30 m, and the temporal resolution is daily with a 5 day revisit time. The imagery is available in Worldview/GIBS approximately 2 - 4 days after satellite overpass. There is a separate combined Landsat 8 and 9 imagery layer available.

This imagery layer is provided dynamically through the [NASA Interagency Implementation and Advanced Concepts Team (IMPACT)](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/esds/impact). As it is dynamically generated, it may take slightly longer to display than normal. The imagery is also only available at higher zoom levels.
