### About HLS
The Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 (HLS) project provides consistent surface reflectance data from the Operational Land Imager (OLI) aboard the joint NASA/USGS Landsat 8 and 9 satellites and the Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) aboard the European Unionâ€™s Copernicus Sentinel-2A, Sentinel-2B, and Sentinel-2C satellites. The combined measurements between Landsat 8, Landsat 9, Sentinel-2A, Sentinel-2B, and Sentinel-2C enable global observations of the land every 2-3 days at 30 meter (m) spatial resolution. The HLS project uses a set of algorithms to obtain seamless products from OLI and MSI that include atmospheric correction, cloud and cloud-shadow masking, spatial co-registration and common gridding, illumination and view angle normalization, and spectral bandpass adjustment.

On January 21, 2025, the Sentinel-2A satellite was replaced with the Sentinel-2C satellite. Therefore, the HLS Sentinel-2 layers contains a mix of imagery from Sentinel-2A, Sentinel-2B, and Sentinel-2C.

- Sentinel-2A: November 28, 2015 to January 22, 2025
- Sentinel-2B: September 18, 2017 to Present
- Sentinel-2C: January 21, 2025 to Present

NOTE: Stray swaths of incorrectly dated imagery may appear near the dateline by eastern Australia/New Zealand due to an artifact caused by USGS and ESA using UTC time to name the Landsat and Sentinel-2 Level 1 products. The observations are labeled one day early with respect to the local time.
