### About HLS
The Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 (HLS) project provides consistent surface reflectance data from the Operational Land Imager (OLI) aboard the joint NASA/USGS Landsat 8 satellite and the Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) aboard the European Unionâ€™s Copernicus Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B satellites. The combined measurements between Landsat 8, Sentinel-2A, and Sentinel-2B enable global observations of the land every 2-3 days at 30 meter (m) spatial resolution. The HLS project uses a set of algorithms to obtain seamless products from OLI and MSI that include atmospheric correction, cloud and cloud-shadow masking, spatial co-registration and common gridding, illumination and view angle normalization, and spectral bandpass adjustment.

Note: PROVISIONAL - The Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 (HLS) data have not been validated for their science quality and should not be used in science research or applications.
