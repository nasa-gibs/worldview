The dynamically generated Reflectance (Bands 8-4-3, False Color) imagery layer is a false color composite that is used to gauge plant health and assess plant density. Plants reflect in near infrared and green light, while absorbing in red. reas with better vegetation health appear red, and denser plant growth is a darker red. Cities, urban areas, and exposed ground appear grey or tan and water is blue or black.

The Reflectance imagery layer from Sentinel-2A and -2B/MSI product (S30) is available through the HLS project from the Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) aboard the European Union’s Copernicus Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B satellites. The sensor resolution is 10, 20, and 60 m, imagery resolution is resampled to 30 m, and the temporal resolution is daily with a 5 day revisit time. The imagery is available in Worldview/GIBS approximately 2 - 4 days after satellite overpass. There is a separate combined Landsat 8 and 9 imagery layer available.

This imagery layer is provided dynamically through the [NASA Interagency Implementation and Advanced Concepts Team (IMPACT)](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/esds/impact). As it is dynamically generated, it may take slightly longer to display than normal. The imagery is also only available at higher zoom levels.
