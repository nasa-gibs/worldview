The dynamically generated Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI) (B3-B11)/(B3+B11) imagery layer is an index for quantifying snow cover. It can also be used to differentiate snow from cloud cover because while snow absorbs in the shortwave infrared light, it reflects the visible light, and cloud is generally reflective in both wavelengths. Snow cover is shown in dark blues. It is calculated using the calculation NDSI = (B3-B11)/(B3+B11).

The Reflectance imagery layer from Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B /MSI product (S30) is available through the HLS project from the Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) aboard the European Unionâ€™s Copernicus Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B satellites. The sensor resolution is 10, 20, and 60 m, imagery resolution is resampled to 30 m, and the temporal resolution is daily with a 5 day revisit time. The imagery is available in Worldview/GIBS approximately 2 - 4 days after satellite overpass. There is a separate combined Landsat 8 and 9 imagery layer available.

This imagery layer is provided dynamically through the [NASA Interagency Implementation and Advanced Concepts Team (IMPACT)](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/esds/impact). As it is dynamically generated, it may take slightly longer to display than normal. The imagery is only available at higher zoom levels.
