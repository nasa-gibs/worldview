The dynamically generated Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) (B3-B8)/(B3+B8) imagery layer is useful for identifying water bodies and to monitor changes related to water content in water bodies. It is calculated using green and near infrared wavelengths using the caculation NDWI = (B3-B8)/(B3+B8). The index can overestimate water bodies as it is sensitive to built-up areas. Teal and blues indicate water bodies.

The Reflectance imagery layer from Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B /MSI product (S30) is available through the HLS project from the Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) aboard the European Unionâ€™s Copernicus Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B satellites. The sensor resolution is 10, 20, and 60 m, imagery resolution is resampled to 30 m, and the temporal resolution is daily with a 5 day revisit time. The imagery is available in Worldview/GIBS approximately 2 - 4 days after satellite overpass. There is a separate combined Landsat 8 and 9 imagery layer available.

This imagery layer is provided dynamically through the [NASA Interagency Implementation and Advanced Concepts Team (IMPACT)](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/esds/impact). As it is dynamically generated, it may take slightly longer to display than normal. The imagery is only available at higher zoom levels.
