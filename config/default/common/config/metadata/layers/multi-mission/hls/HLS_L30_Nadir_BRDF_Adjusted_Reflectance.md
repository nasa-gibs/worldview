The Reflectance (Nadir BRDF Adjusted) imagery layer from Landsat 8 and 9/OLI is a true-color or natural color image because this combination of wavelengths is similar to what the human eye would see. It consists of natural-looking images of land surface, oceanic and atmospheric features. The Reflectance (Nadir BRDF Adjusted) imagery layer from Landsat 8 and 9/OLI provides 30m Nadir Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF)-Adjusted Reflectance (NBAR) and is derived from a combination of the joint NASA/USGS Landsat 8 and Landsat 9 Operational Land Imager (OLI) data products through the Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 (HLS) project.

The Reflectance (Nadir BRDF Adjusted) imagery layer from Landsat 8 and 9/OLI product (L30) is available through the HLS project from the Operational Land Imager (OLI) aboard the Landsat 8 and 9 satellites. The sensor resolution is 30 m, imagery resolution is 30 m, and the temporal resolution is daily with a 16 day revisit time. The imagery is available in Worldview/GIBS approximately 2 - 4 days after satellite overpass. There is a separate combined Sentinel 2A and Sentinel 2B imagery layer available.
