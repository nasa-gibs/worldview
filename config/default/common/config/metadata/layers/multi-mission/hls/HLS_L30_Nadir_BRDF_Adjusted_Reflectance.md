The Reflectance (Nadir BRDF Adjusted, v1.5) imagery layer from Landsat 8/OLI is a true-color or natural color image because this combination of wavelengths is similar to what the human eye would see. It consists of natural-looking images of land surface, oceanic and atmospheric features. The Reflectance (Nadir BRDF Adjusted, v1.5) imagery layer from Landsat 8/OLI provides 30m Nadir Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF)-Adjusted Reflectance (NBAR) and is derived from the joint NASA/USGS Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) data product through the Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 (HLS) project.

The Reflectance (Nadir BRDF Adjusted, v1.5) imagery layer from Landsat 8/OLI product (L30) is available through the HLS project from the Operational Land Imager (OLI) aboard the Landsat 8. The sensor resolution is 30 m, imagery resolution is 30 m, and the temporal resolution is daily with a 16 day revisit time. The imagery is available in Worldview/GIBS approximately 2 - 4 days after satellite overpass. There is a separate combined Sentinel 2A and Sentinel 2B imagery layer available.
