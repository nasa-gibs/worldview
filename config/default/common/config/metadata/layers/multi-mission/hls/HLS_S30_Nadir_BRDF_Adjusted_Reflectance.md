The Reflectance (Nadir BRDF Adjusted) imagery layer from Sentinel-2/MSI is a true-color or natural color image because this combination of wavelengths is similar to what the human eye would see. It consists of natural-looking images of land surface, oceanic and atmospheric features. The Reflectance (Nadir BRDF Adjusted) imagery layer from Sentinel-2/MSI provides 30m Nadir Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF)-Adjusted Reflectance (NBAR) and is derived from a combination of the European Union’s Copernicus Sentinel-2 Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) data products through the Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 (HLS) project.

The Reflectance (Nadir BRDF-Adjusted) product (S30) is available through the HLS project from the Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) aboard the European Union’s Copernicus Sentinel-2A, Sentinel-2B, and Sentinel-2C satellites. The sensor resolution is 10, 20, and 60 m, imagery resolution is resampled to 30 m, and the temporal resolution is daily with a 5 day revisit time. The imagery is available in Worldview/GIBS approximately 2 - 4 days after satellite overpass. There is a separate combined Landsat 8 and 9 imagery layer available.

On January 21, 2025, the Sentinel-2C satellite replaced Sentinel-2A satellite. In addition, a [temporary one year extension campaign](https://sentinels.copernicus.eu/-/sentinel-2a-extended-campaign-starting-march-13-2025) of Sentinel-2A began on March 13, 2025. This campaign provides increased observations over Europe, and tropical regions of Africa and South America.

This layer contains a mix of imagery from Sentinel-2A, Sentinel-2B, and Sentinel-2C:
- Sentinel-2A: November 28, 2015 to January 22, 2025; March 14, 2025 to approximately March 2026.
- Sentinel-2B: September 18, 2017 to Present
- Sentinel-2C: January 21, 2025 to Present
