The Reflectance (Nadir BRDF Adjusted, v1.5) imagery layer from Sentinel 2A and 2B/MSI is a true-color or natural color image because this combination of wavelengths is similar to what the human eye would see. It consists of natural-looking images of land surface, oceanic and atmospheric features. The Reflectance (Nadir BRDF Adjusted, v1.5) imagery layer from Sentinel 2A and 2B/MSI provides 30m Nadir Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF)-Adjusted Reflectance (NBAR) and is derived from a combination of the European Union’s Copernicus Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) data products through the Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 (HLS) project.

The Reflectance (Nadir BRDF-Adjusted, v1.5) product (S30) is available through the HLS project from the Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) aboard the European Union’s Copernicus Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B satellites. The sensor resolution is 10, 20, and 60 m, imagery resolution is resampled to 30 m, and the temporal resolution is daily with a 5 day revisit time. The imagery is available in Worldview/GIBS approximately 2 - 4 days after satellite overpass. There is a separate Landsat imagery layer available.
