**NOTE: This layer is undergoing beta testing.**

The dynamically generated Triangular Vegetation Index imagery layer is good for estimating green leaf area index (LAI), but its sensitivity to chlorophyll increases with an increase in canopy density.

It is calculated using:

`TVI = 120(NIR - Green) - 200(Red-Green) / 2`

Specifically for Landsat 8 and 9:

`TVI = 120(Band 5 â€“ Band 3) - 200(Band 4 - Band 3) / 2`

The image is applied with a divergent blue-green to brown color palette. It depicts areas with a lot of green leaf growth, indicating the presence of chlorophyll, in dark green colors. Chlorophyll reflects more infrared light and less visible light. Areas with some green leaf growth are in light yellows, and areas with little to no vegetation growth are in shades of brown.

The Reflectance imagery layer from Landsat 8 and 9/OLI product (L30) is available through the HLS project from the Operational Land Imager (OLI) aboard the Landsat 8 and 9 satellites. The sensor resolution is 30 m, imagery resolution is 30 m, and the temporal resolution is daily with an 8 day revisit time. The imagery is available in Worldview/GIBS approximately 2 - 4 days after satellite overpass. There is a separate combined Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B imagery layer available.

Landsat 9 launched on September 21, 2021 and was subsequently added to the HLS product, availability of imagery from Landsat 8 and Landsat 9 is as follows:
- Landsat 8: April 11, 2013 - Present
- Landsat 9: May 31, 2022 - Present

This imagery layer is provided dynamically through the [NASA Interagency Implementation and Advanced Concepts Team (IMPACT)](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/about/impact). As it is dynamically generated, it may take slightly longer to display than normal. The imagery is only available at higher zoom levels.
