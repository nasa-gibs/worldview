**NOTE: This layer is undergoing beta testing.**

The dynamically generated Reflectance (Bands 4-3-2, True Color) imagery layer is a true-color or natural color image because this combination of wavelengths is similar to what the human eye would see. It consists of natural-looking images of land surface, oceanic and atmospheric features.

The Reflectance imagery layer from Sentinel 2A and 2B/MSI product (S30) is available through the HLS project from the Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) aboard the European Unionâ€™s Copernicus Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B satellites. The sensor resolution is 10, 20, and 60 m, imagery resolution is resampled to 30 m, and the temporal resolution is daily with a 5 day revisit time. The imagery is available in Worldview/GIBS approximately 2 - 4 days after satellite overpass. There is a separate combined Landsat 8 and 9 imagery layer available.

This imagery layer is provided dynamically through the [NASA Interagency Implementation and Advanced Concepts Team (IMPACT)](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/esds/impact). As it is dynamically generated, it may take slightly longer to display than normal. The imagery is also only available at higher zoom levels.
