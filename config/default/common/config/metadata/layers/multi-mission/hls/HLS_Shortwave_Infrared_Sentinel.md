The dynamically generated Reflectance (Bands 12-8A-4, Shortwave Infrared) imagery layer is useful looking at how much water is present in plants and soils, as water absorbs in shortwave infrared wavelengths. It can be used to distinguish between cloud types like water clouds versus ice clouds, snow and ice, which appear white. Vegetation is in shades of green, soils and urban areas are in shades of brown, and water is black. Freshly burned areas appear red.

The Reflectance imagery layer from Sentinel 2A and 2B/MSI product (S30) is available through the HLS project from the Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) aboard the European Unionâ€™s Copernicus Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B satellites. The sensor resolution is 10, 20, and 60 m, imagery resolution is resampled to 30 m, and the temporal resolution is daily with a 5 day revisit time. The imagery is available in Worldview/GIBS approximately 2 - 4 days after satellite overpass. There is a separate combined Landsat 8 and 9 imagery layer available.

This imagery layer is provided dynamically through the [NASA Interagency Implementation and Advanced Concepts Team (IMPACT)](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/esds/impact). As it is dynamically generated, it may take slightly longer to display than normal. The imagery is also only available at higher zoom levels.
