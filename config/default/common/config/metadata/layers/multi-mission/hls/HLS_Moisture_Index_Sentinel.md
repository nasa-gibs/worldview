The dynamically generated Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI) (B8A-B11)/(B8A+B11) imagery layer is an index to determine vegetation water content and monitor drought. It is calculated using near infrared and shortwave infrared (SWIR) wavelengths using the calculation NDMI = (B8A-B11)/(B8A+B11). On the rainbow color scale, darker blue colors represent high canopy without water stress, and greenish to yellow colors area areas approaching water stress.

The Reflectance imagery layer from Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B /MSI product (S30) is available through the HLS project from the Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) aboard the European Unionâ€™s Copernicus Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B satellites. The sensor resolution is 10, 20, and 60 m, imagery resolution is resampled to 30 m, and the temporal resolution is daily with a 5 day revisit time. The imagery is available in Worldview/GIBS approximately 2 - 4 days after satellite overpass. There is a separate combined Landsat 8 and 9 imagery layer available.

This imagery layer is provided dynamically through the [NASA Interagency Implementation and Advanced Concepts Team (IMPACT)](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/esds/impact). As it is dynamically generated, it may take slightly longer to display than normal. The imagery is only available at higher zoom levels.
