The dynamically generated Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI) (B8A-B11)/(B8A+B11) imagery layer is an index to determine vegetation water content and monitor drought. It is calculated using near infrared and shortwave infrared (SWIR) wavelengths.

It is calculated using:

`NDMI = (B8A-B11)/(B8A+B11)`

The image is applied with a divergent blue to red color palette. The image is applied with a divergent blue to red color palette. Darker blue colors represent high canopy without water stress, and red colors are areas approaching water stress.

The Reflectance imagery layer from Sentinel-2/MSI product (S30) is available through the HLS project from the Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) aboard the European Unionâ€™s Copernicus Sentinel-2A, Sentinel-2B, and Sentinel-2C satellites. The sensor resolution is 10, 20, and 60 m, imagery resolution is resampled to 30 m, and the temporal resolution is daily with a 5 day revisit time. The imagery is available in Worldview/GIBS approximately 2 - 4 days after satellite overpass. There is a separate combined Landsat 8 and 9 imagery layer available.

On January 21, 2025, the Sentinel-2C satellite replaced Sentinel-2A satellite. This layer contains a mix of imagery from Sentinel-2A, Sentinel-2B, and Sentinel-2C.
- Sentinel-2A: November 28, 2015 to January 22, 2025
- Sentinel-2B: September 18, 2017 to Present
- Sentinel-2C: January 21, 2025 to Present

This imagery layer is provided dynamically through the [NASA Interagency Implementation and Advanced Concepts Team (IMPACT)](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/about/impact). As it is dynamically generated, it may take slightly longer to display than normal. The imagery is only available at higher zoom levels.
