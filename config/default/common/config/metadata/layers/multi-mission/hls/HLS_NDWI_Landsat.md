The dynamically generated Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) (B3-B5)/(B3+B5) imagery layer is useful for identifying water bodies and to monitor changes related to water content in water bodies. It is calculated using green and near infrared wavelengths using the caculation NDWI = (B3-B5)/(B3+B5). The index can overestimate water bodies as it is sensitive to built-up areas. Teal and blues indicate water bodies.

The Reflectance imagery layer from Landsat 8 and 9/OLI product (L30) is available through the HLS project from the Operational Land Imager (OLI) aboard the Landsat 8 and 9 satellites. The sensor resolution is 30 m, imagery resolution is 30 m, and the temporal resolution is daily with an 8 day revisit time. The imagery is available in Worldview/GIBS approximately 2 - 4 days after satellite overpass. There is a separate combined Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B  imagery layer available.

This imagery layer is provided dynamically through the [NASA Interagency Implementation and Advanced Concepts Team (IMPACT)](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/esds/impact). As it is dynamically generated, it may take slightly longer to display than normal. The imagery is also only available at higher zoom levels.
