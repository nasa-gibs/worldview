The reflectance (True Color) imagery from January 8 to 20, 2025 of the January 2025 fires in the Los Angeles area of California was made available from [Maxar's Open Data Program](https://www.maxar.com/open-data) via [NOAAâ€™s National Geodetic Survey Emergency Response Imagery](https://storms.ngs.noaa.gov/). The imagery is from the MAXAR constellation of satellites including, but not limited to, WorldView 2, WorldView 3, Worldview Legion 2, and GeoEye-1. The spatial resolution determined by the ground sample distance (GSD) for each pixel is approximately 30 cm.

Aerial imagery from January 28, 2025 was acquired to support response efforts for the California fires. The aerial photography missions were conducted by the NOAA Remote Sensing Division. The images were acquired using a Digital Sensor System (DSS) version 6. The spatial resolution determined by the ground sample distance (GSD) for each pixel is approximately 7.5 cm.
