The Cloud Liquid Water Path (L3, Daily) layer is the integrated liquid water, cloud water only, in the atmospheric column in units of grams per square meter (g/m<sup>2</sup>).

The Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR) instrument provides global passive microwave measurements of terrestrial, oceanic, and atmospheric parameters for the investigation of global water and energy cycles.

The "AMSR-E/AMSR2 Unified L3 Global Daily Ascending/Descending .25x.25 deg Ocean Grids" data set (AU_DyOcn) reports daily estimates of water vapor, cloud liquid water content, and surface wind speed over the ocean on a global 0.25° × 0.25° resolution grid. The data are derived from AMSR-E and AMSR2 brightness temperature observations that have been resampled by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) to facilitate an intercalibrated (i.e., “unified”) AMSR-E/AMSR2 data record.

The imagery resolution is 2 km and sensor resolution is 0.25 degrees x 0.25 degrees. The temporal resolution is daily.
