The Ocean Wind Speed (L3, Weekly) layer shows daily estimates of surface wind speed over oceans in meters per second (m/s) at 10 meter altitude above the ocean surface.

The Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR) instrument provides global passive microwave measurements of terrestrial, oceanic, and atmospheric parameters for the investigation of global water and energy cycles.

The "AMSR-E/AMSR2 Unified L3 Global Weekly Ascending/Descending .25x0.25 deg Ocean Grids" data set (AU_WkOcn) reports weekly estimates of water vapor, cloud liquid water content, and surface wind speed over the ocean on a global 0.25° × 0.25° resolution grid. The data are derived from AMSR-E and AMSR2 brightness temperature observations that have been resampled by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) to facilitate an intercalibrated (i.e., “unified”) AMSR-E/AMSR2 data record.

The imagery resolution is 2 km and sensor resolution is 0.25 degrees x 0.25 degrees. The temporal resolution is weekly.
