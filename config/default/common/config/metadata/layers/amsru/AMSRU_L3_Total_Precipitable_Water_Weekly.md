The Total Precipitable Water (L3, Weekly) layer displays the integrated water vapor in the atmospheric columnn in millimeters (mm).

The Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR) instrument provides global passive microwave measurements of terrestrial, oceanic, and atmospheric parameters for the investigation of global water and energy cycles.

The AMSR-E/AMSR2 Unified L3 Global Weekly Ascending/Descending .25 x .25 deg Ocean Grids data set (AU_WkOcn) reports weekly estimates of water vapor, cloud liquid water content, and surface wind speed over the ocean on a global 0.25° × 0.25° resolution grid. The data are derived from AMSR-E and AMSR2 brightness temperature observations that have been resampled by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) to facilitate an intercalibrated (i.e., “unified”) AMSR-E/AMSR2 data record.

The imagery resolution is 2 km and sensor resolution is 0.25 degrees x 0.25 degrees. The temporal resolution is weekly.
