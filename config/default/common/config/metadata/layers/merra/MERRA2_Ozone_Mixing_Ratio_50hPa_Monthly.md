The Ozone Mixing Ratio at 50hPa (Monthly) layer is created from the M2IMNPANA data collection. M2IMNPANA (or instM_3d_ana_Np) is an instantaneous 3-dimensional monthly mean data collection in Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications version 2 (MERRA-2). This collection consists of analyzed meteorological fields at 42 pressure levels, such as temperature, wind components, specific humidity, ozone mixing ratio, and geopotential height. The information on the pressure levels can be found in the section 4.2 of the MERRA-2 File Specification document. The collection also includes certain quadratic information (such as the variance and covariance of certain parameters). MERRA-2 is the latest version of global atmospheric reanalysis for the satellite era produced by NASA Global Modeling and Assimilation Office (GMAO) using the Goddard Earth Observing System Model (GEOS) version 5.12.4.
