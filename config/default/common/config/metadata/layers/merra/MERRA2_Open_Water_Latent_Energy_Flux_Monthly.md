The MERRA-2 Open Water Latent Energy Flux (Monthly) layer is created from M2TMNXOCN (or tavgM_2d_ocn_Nx). M2TMNXOCN is a time-averaged 2-dimensional monthly mean data collection in Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications version 2 (MERRA-2). This collection consists of ocean surface diagnostics, such as open water skin temperature (sea surface temperature), open water latent energy flux, open water upward sensible heat flux, and open water net downward longwave (or shortwave) flux. The collection also includes variance of certain parameters. MERRA-2 is the latest version of global atmospheric reanalysis for the satellite era produced by NASA Global Modeling and Assimilation Office (GMAO) using the Goddard Earth Observing System Model (GEOS) version 5.12.4.
