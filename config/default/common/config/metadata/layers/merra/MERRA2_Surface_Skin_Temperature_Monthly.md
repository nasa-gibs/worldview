The Surface Skin Temperature (Monthly) layer is an atmospheric reanalysis product from NASA second Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA-2), produced by the Goddard Earth Observing System Model, Version 5 (GEOS-5) data assimilation system. The layer’s units are in Kelvin (K). The monthly surface skin temperature is time aggregated from corresponding hourly data with spatial resolution of 0.625° × 0.5°.

This parameter (TS) was extracted from the product M2TMNXSLV.5.12.4 (Monthly mean, Time-Averaged, Single-Level, Assimilation, Single-Level Diagnostics).
