The 2-meter Air Temperature, Assimilated (Monthly) layer is created from the M2IMNXASM (or instM_2d_asm_Nx) data collection. M2IMNXASM is an instantaneous 2-dimensional monthly mean data collection in Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications version 2 (MERRA-2). This collection consists of assimilations of meteorological diagnostic parameters at the single levels, such as temperature at 2-meter and 10-meter; wind components at 2-meter, 10-meter, and 50-meter; surface pressure, and total precipitable water. The collection also includes variance of certain parameters. MERRA-2 is the latest version of global atmospheric reanalysis for the satellite era produced by NASA Global Modeling and Assimilation Office (GMAO) using the Goddard Earth Observing System Model (GEOS) version 5.12.4.
