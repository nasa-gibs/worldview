The Incident Shortwave Over Land (Monthly) layer is created from the M2TMNXLFO data collection. M2TMNXLFO (or tavgM_2d_lfo_Nx) is a time-averaged 2-dimensional monthly mean data collection in Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications version 2 (MERRA-2). This collection consists of land surface forcing parameters, such as bias corrected precipitation, shortwave and longwave radiation at surface. The collection also includes variance of certain parameters. MERRA-2 is the latest version of global atmospheric reanalysis for the satellite era produced by NASA Global Modeling and Assimilation Office (GMAO) using the Goddard Earth Observing System Model (GEOS) version 5.12.4.
