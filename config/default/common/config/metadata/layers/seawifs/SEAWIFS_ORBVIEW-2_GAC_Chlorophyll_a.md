The SeaWiFS Chlorophyll *a* layer provides the near-surface concentration of chlorophyll *a* in milligrams of chlorophyll pigment per cubic meter (mg/m<sup>3</sup>) in the ocean.

The SeaWiFS instrument was launched by Orbital Sciences Corporation on the OrbView-2 (a.k.a. SeaStar) satellite in August 1997, and collected data from September 1997 until the end of mission in December 2010. SeaWiFS had 8 spectral bands from 412 to 865 nm. It collected global data at 4 km resolution, and local data (limited onboard storage and direct broadcast) at 1 km. The mission and sensor were optimized for ocean color measurements, with a local noon (descending) equator crossing time orbit, fore-and-aft tilt capability, full dynamic range, and low polarization sensitivity.

The SeaWiFS Chlorophyll *a* (Global Area Coverage (GAC)) product is available from the OrbView-2 satellite for September 4, 1997 to December 11, 2010. The sensor and imagery resolution is 4 km, and the temporal resolution is daily.
