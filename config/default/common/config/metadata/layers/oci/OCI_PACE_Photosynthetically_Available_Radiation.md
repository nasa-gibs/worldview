The Photosynthetically Available Radiation layer displays photosynthetically available radiation over oceans and large bodies of water and is measured in einstein/m²/day.

The Photosynthetically Available Radiation product is available from the Ocean Color Instrument (OCI) aboard NASA's Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, ocean Ecosystem (PACE) satellite. The sensor resolution is 1.2 km, imagery resolution is 1 km, and the temporal resolution is daily.
