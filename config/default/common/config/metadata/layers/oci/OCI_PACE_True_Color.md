These images are called true-color or natural color because this combination of wavelengths is similar to what the human eye would see. The images are natural-looking images of land surface, oceanic and atmospheric features. The downside of this set of bands is that they tend to produce a hazy image.

The sensor resolution is 1.2 km, imagery resolution is 1 km, and the temporal resolution is daily.
