The Liquid Water Equivalent Thickness (Mascon, CRI) layer provides global water storage anomalies relative to a time-mean of monthly mass grids as derived from GRACE. This version employs a Coastal Resolution Improvement (CRI) filter that reduces leakage errors across coastlines. The storage anomalies are given in equivalent water thickness units (cm).
