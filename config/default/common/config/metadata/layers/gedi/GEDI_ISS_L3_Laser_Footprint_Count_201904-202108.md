The Valid Laser Footprint Count (L3, v2, 2019 APR to 2021 AUG) layer shows the number of valid laser footprints per 1 km x 1 km grid cell. This layer is from the version 2 release of the Global Elevation Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) L3 gridded land surface metrics data covering the period between the 19th and the 138th mission weeks (2019 APR 19 - 2021 AUG 04). It is derived from the GEDI L2 version 2 geolocated laser footprints metric data products. The imagery resolution is 1 km and is available globally within -52 and 52 degrees latitude.
