The Ground Elevation Standard Deviation (L3, v1, 2019 APR to 2020 APR) layer is the standard deviation of the ground elevation of the lowest mode of valid footprints per 1 km x 1 km grid cell. This layer is from the version 1, initial release of the Global Elevation Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) L3 gridded land surface metrics data, covering the period between the 19th and the 70th mission weeks (2019-04-18 to 2020-04-15). It is derived from the GEDI L2 version 1 geolocated laser footprints metric data products. The imagery resolution is 1 km and is available globally within -52 and 52 degrees latitude.
