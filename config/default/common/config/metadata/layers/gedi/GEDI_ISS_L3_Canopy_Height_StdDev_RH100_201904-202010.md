The Canopy Height Standard Deviation (L3, v2, 2019 APR - 2020 OCT) layer is the standard deviation of RH100 for all valid footprints per 1 km x 1 km grid cell. RH100 or relative height is the 100th percentile of waveform energy relative to ground elevation. This layer is from the version 2 release of the Global Elevation Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) L3 gridded land surface metrics data covering the period between the 19th and the 96th mission weeks (2019 APR 18 - 2020 OCT 13). It is derived from the GEDI L2B version 2 geolocated laser footprints metric data product. The imagery resolution is 1 km and is available globally within -52 and 52 degrees latitude.
