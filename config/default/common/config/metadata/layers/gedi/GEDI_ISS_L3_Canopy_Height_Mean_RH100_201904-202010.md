The Canopy Height Mean (L3, v2, 2019 APR - 2020 OCT) layer shows the canopy height as the mean height (in meters) above the ground of the received waveform signal that was the first reflection off the top of the canopy (RH100). RH100 or relative height is the 100th percentile of waveform energy relative to ground elevation. This layer is from the version 2 release of the Global Elevation Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) L3 gridded land surface metrics data covering the period between the 19th and the 96th mission weeks (2019 APR 18 - 2020 OCT 13). It is derived from the GEDI L2B version 2 geolocated laser footprints RH100 data product. The imagery resolution is 1 km and is available globally within -52 and 52 degrees latitude.
