The Ground Elevation Standard Deviation (L3, v2, 2019 APR - 2021 AUG) layer is the standard deviation of the ground elevation of the lowest mode of valid footprints per 1 km x 1 km grid cell. This layer is from the version 2 release of the Global Elevation Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) L3 gridded land surface metrics data covering the period between the 19th and the 138th mission weeks (2019 APR 19 - 2021 AUG 04). It is derived from the GEDI L2 version 2 geolocated laser footprints metric data products. The imagery resolution is 1 km and is available globally within -52 and 52 degrees latitude.
