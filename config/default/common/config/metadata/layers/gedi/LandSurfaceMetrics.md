### About GEDI L3 Gridded Land Surface Metrics
The GEDI L3 Gridded Land Surface Metrics dataset provides Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation ([GEDI](https://gedi.umd.edu/)) Level 3 (L3) gridded mean canopy height, standard deviation of canopy height, mean ground elevation, standard deviation of ground elevation, and counts of laser footprints per 1 km x 1 km grid cells globally within -52 and 52 degrees latitude.

L3 gridded products can be used to characterize important carbon and water cycling processes, biodiversity, habitat and can also be of immense value for climate modeling, forest management, snow and glacier monitoring, and the generation of digital elevation models.

### About GEDI
The Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) produces high resolution laser ranging of Earth’s forests and topography from the International Space Station (ISS). GEDI’s precise measurements of forest canopy height, canopy vertical structure, and surface elevation greatly advance our ability to characterize important carbon and water cycling processes, biodiversity, and habitat. GEDI was funded as a NASA Earth Ventures Instrument (EVI) mission. It was launched to the ISS in December 2018 and completed initial orbit checkout in April 2019.
