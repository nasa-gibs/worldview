The ISS LIS Flash Radiance layer provides the radiance of lightning flashes measured in &mu;J/sr/m<sup>2</sup>/&mu;m as recorded by the Lightning Imaging Sensor (LIS) on board the International Space Station (ISS).The ISS LIS provides total lightning measurements between +/- 48 degrees latitude which covers a geographic range that includes nearly all global lightning. ISS LIS monitors total global lightning in both day and night and provides important cross-sensor calibration and validation with the Geostationary Lightning Mapper (GLM) and ground-based lightning networks.

ISS LIS supplies near real-time lightning data over data-sparse regions, such as oceans, to support operational weather forecasting and warning. ISS LIS standard science products are available at GHRC DAAC.
