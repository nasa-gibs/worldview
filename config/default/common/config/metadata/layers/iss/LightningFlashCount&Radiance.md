### About LIS
The Lightning Imaging Sensor [LIS](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/data/instruments/lis) was placed on the International Space Station in Feb 2017. LIS is mounted to the station as part of the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) Space Test Program (STP)-H5 science and technology development payload. By placing LIS on the space station, which has a highly inclined orbit, a greater geographic range of measurements are obtained than previously measured by TRMM LIS.
