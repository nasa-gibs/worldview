The Infrared 10.8 μm (IR10.8 μm) Geostationary Ring layer is composed of 3-hourly imagery of infrared channels Level 1b Brightness Temperatures from different geostationary satellites to provide near global coverage: Meteosat 0 Degree and Meteosat IODC (SEVIRI, channel IR10.8); GOES-East and GOES-West (Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI), channel IR10.3); Himawari-9 (Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI), channel IR10.4).

These IR channels provide continuous, day and night, temperature readings of clouds, land and sea surfaces, aids in cloud and other atmospheric feature identification/classification (e.g. estimation of cloud top height). These IR channels are so-called atmospheric window channels (where the absorption of the gas molecules is low).

The imagery is updated every 3 hours.

This imagery has been made available through an API service of [Geostationary Ring IR10.8 μm - Multimission](https://data.eumetsat.int/product/EO:EUM:DAT:0336) provided by the European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites ([EUMETSAT](http://www.eumetsat.int/)).
