The Volcanic Ash Geostationary Ring layer is composed of 3-hourly imagery of RGB Ash products from different geostationary satellites to provide near global coverage: Meteosat 0 Degree and Meteosat IODC, GOES-East and GOES-West, Himawari-9. The imagery is produced by assigning red, green and blue to imagery from infrared channel data from the following instruments: SEVIRI (Meteosat): IR12.0, IR10.8, IR8.7 channels; ABI (GOES-16 and GOES-18): IR12.3, IR10.3, IR11.2, IR8.4 channels; AHI (Himawari-9): IR10.4, IR12.4, IR8.6, IR11.2 channels.

The layer is designed to detect ash and sulfur dioxide (SO2) from volcanic eruptions. As it is based solely on IR channels, this product has the same utility both during day and night.

The imagery is updated every 3 hours.

This imagery has been made available through an API service of [Geostationary Ring Volcanic Ash RGB - Multimission](https://data.eumetsat.int/product/EO:EUM:DAT:0332) provided by the European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites ([EUMETSAT](http://www.eumetsat.int/)).
