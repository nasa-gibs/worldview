The Brightness Temperature Difference Day (Daily, 8.65μm-12.05μm) layer displays brightness temperature difference in Kelvin (K). Brightness temperature difference is used to identify the presence of small cloud crystals or water droplets, which induce large positive inter-channel brightness temperature differences sometimes exceeding +10 K. In clear sky conditions, inter-channel brightness temperature differences are due to different atmospheric absorptions and surface properties and can be either positive or negative.

This layer is based on the CAL_IIR_L2_Swath-Standard-V4-51, the CALIPSO Infrared Imaging Radiometer (IIR) Level 2 Swath, Version 4-51 data product. Data for this product was collected using the CALIPSO IIR instrument. This product contains emissivity and cloud particle size data assigned to IIR pixels on a 1 km grid centered on the lidar track.

The Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) satellite was launched on April 28, 2006, to study the impact of clouds and aerosols on the Earth's radiation budget and climate. The CALIPSO satellite comprises three instruments: Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP), Infrared Imaging Radiometer (IIR), and Wide Field Camera (WFC). CALIPSO is a joint satellite mission between NASA and the French Agency CNES (Centre national d'études spatiales).

The imagery resolution is 1 km and sensor resolution is 1 km. The swath is 69-km wide. The temporal resolution is daily.
