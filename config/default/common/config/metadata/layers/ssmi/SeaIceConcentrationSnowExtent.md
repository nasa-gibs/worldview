### Sea Ice Concentration and Snow Extent
Temporal Coverage: 17 August 2009 â€“ present

The Sea Ice Concentration and Snow Extent layer (also known as the Near-real-time Ice and Snow Extent (NISE) data set) provides daily imagery of sea ice concentrations and snow extent for the polar regions from the SSM/I and SSMIS passive microwave sensors on board the DMSP 5D-2/F13, DMSP 5D-3/F17 and DMSP 5D-3/F18 platforms. This imagery is meant to provide a best estimate of current ice and snow conditions based on information and algorithms available at the time the data are acquired. These data are not suitable for time series, anomalies, or trends analyses.

The sensor/algorithm resolution is 25 km, imagery resolution is 1 km, and the temporal resolution is daily.
