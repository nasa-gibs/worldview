The Cloud Liquid Water Path (L3, Monthly) layer is the integrated liquid water, cloud water only, in the atmospheric column in units of grams per square meter (g/m<sup>2</sup>).

The Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) instrument on the Global Change Observation Mission - Water 1 (GCOM-W1) provides global passive microwave measurements of terrestrial, oceanic, and atmospheric parameters for the investigation of global water and energy cycles.

The AMSR-E/AMSR2 Unified L3 Global Monthly Ascending/Descending .25x.25 deg Ocean Grids data set (AU_MoOcn) is a gridded product that reports monthly estimates of water vapor, cloud liquid water content, and surface wind speed over the ocean. The data are derived from resampled Near Real-Time (NRT) Level-1R data provided by Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA).

The imagery resolution is 2 km and sensor resolution is 0.25 degrees x 0.25 degrees. The temporal resolution is monthly.
