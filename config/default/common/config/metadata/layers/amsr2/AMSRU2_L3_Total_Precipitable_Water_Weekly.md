The Total Precipitable Water (L3, Weekly) layer displays the integrated water vapor in the atmospheric columnn in millimeters (mm).

The Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) instrument on the Global Change Observation Mission - Water 1 (GCOM-W1) provides global passive microwave measurements of terrestrial, oceanic, and atmospheric parameters for the investigation of global water and energy cycles.

The AMSR-E/AMSR2 Unified L3 Global Weekly Ascending/Descending .25 x .25 deg Ocean Grids data set (AU_WkOcn) reports weekly estimates of water vapor, cloud liquid water content, and surface wind speed over the ocean on a global 0.25° × 0.25° resolution grid. The data are derived from the AMSR-E/AMSR2 Unified L2B Global Swath Ocean Products, Version 1 data set.

The imagery resolution is 2 km and sensor resolution is 0.25 degrees x 0.25 degrees. The temporal resolution is weekly.
