### Brightness Temperature for Sea Ice (89H GHz | 89V GHz)
Temporal coverage: 2 July 2012 - present

The Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-E/Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-2 (AMSR-E/AMSR2) Unified "Brightness Temperature for Sea Ice (89H GHz)" and "Brightness Temperature for Sea Ice (89V GHz)" layers displays sea ice brightness temperatures (TBs) in Kelvin at the Polar regions for the 89 GHz horizontal (H) and 89 GHz vertical (V) polarization. Brightness temperature data are particularly useful for sea ice studies because of the relatively high contrast in emissivities between open water and sea ice.

The Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) instrument is a conically scanning passive microwave radiometer sensing microwave radiation at 12 channels and 6 frequencies ranging from 6.9 to 89 GHz on board the Global Change Observation Mission â€“ Water 1 (GCOM-W1) satellite. This product uses the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) AMSR2 Level-1R input brightness temperatures that are calibrated (unified) across the JAXA AMSR-E and AMSR2 Level-1R products. The imagery resolution is 2 km and sensor resolution is 6.25 km. The temporal resolution is daily.
