### Brightness Temperature for Sea Ice (89H GHz | 89V GHz)
Temporal coverage: 2 July 2012 - present

The Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-E/Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-2 (AMSR-E/AMSR2) unified “Sea Ice Brightness Temperature (89H GHz)” and “Sea Ice Brightness Temperature (89V GHz)” layer displays daily averaged sea ice brightness temperatures (TBs) in kelvin at the polar regions for the 89 GHz horizontal (H) polarization channel and the 89 GHz vertical (V) polarization channel. Brightness temperature (TB) data are particularly useful for sea ice studies because of the relatively high contrast in emissivities between open water and sea ice.

The AMSR2 instrument is a conically scanning passive microwave radiometer. This instrument senses microwave radiation for twelve channels and six frequencies ranging from 6.9 GHz to 89 GHz on board the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) Global Change Observation Mission – Water 1 (GCOM-W1) satellite.

This product uses the JAXA AMSR2 Level-1R input TBs which are calibrated (unified) across the JAXA AMSR-E and AMSR2 Level-1R products.

The imagery resolution is 2 km and sensor resolution is 6.25 km. The temporal resolution is daily.
