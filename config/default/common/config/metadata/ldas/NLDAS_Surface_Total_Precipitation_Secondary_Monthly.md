This NLDAS Precipitation Total parameter is one of the land-surface forcing fields included in the North America Land Data Assimilation System Phase 2 (NLDAS-2) secondary forcing monthly data product. NLDAS-2 secondary forcing Precipitation Total data are derived directly from the analysis fields of the NCEP North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR). The NLDAS monthly Precipitation Total data are generated through temporal accumulation of the hourly data.  The data are in unit “kg/m<sup>2</sup>” which is equivalent to “mm”.  

The NLDAS-2 monthly Precipitation Total is a science variable that indicates the amount of the monthly total precipitation (Liquid precipitation + Frozen precipitation).  The data can be used for supporting research and applications related to global water and energy cycle, drought and flood, climate variability, land surface assimilation, etc.  

The NLDAS Precipitation Total data are in 1/8th-degree grid spacing and the imagery resolution is 2 km, and the temporal resolution is monthly with a latency about 4 days.
