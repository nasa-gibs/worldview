</div>
<p>This <a href="https://github.com/nasa-gibs/worldview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">open source
        code</a> app from NASA's <a href="https://earthdata.nasa.gov/eosdis" target="_blank"
        rel="noopener noreferrer">EOSDIS</a> provides the capability to interactively browse over 1000 global,
    full-resolution satellite imagery layers and then download the underlying data. Many of the imagery layers are
    updated daily and are available within three hours of observation - essentially showing the entire Earth as it
    looks "right now". This supports time-critical application areas such as wildfire management, air quality
    measurements, and flood monitoring. Arctic and Antarctic views of many products are also available for a "full
    globe" perspective. Geostationary imagery layers are also now available. These are provided in ten minute
    increments for the last 90 days. These full disk hemispheric views allow for almost real-time viewing of changes
    occurring around most of the world. Browsing on tablet and smartphone devices is generally supported for mobile
    access to the imagery.</p>

<p>Worldview uses the <a href="https://earthdata.nasa.gov/gibs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Global
        Imagery Browse Services</a> to rapidly retrieve its imagery for an interactive browsing experience. While
    Worldview uses <a href="https://openlayers.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenLayers</a> as its
    mapping library, GIBS imagery can also be accessed from Google Earth, NASA World Wind, and several other
    clients. We encourage interested developers to build their own clients or integrate NASA imagery into their
    existing ones using these services.</p>
