This image shows many lights associated with the oil well pads in the Bakken Formation which lies partly in North Dakota. Clustered city lights are also evident, such as the capital city of Bismarck to the south east and Minot to the east of the oil well pads. Overlaid on the nighttime image are the nighttime fire and thermal anomalies layer, shown as red dots. These thermal anomalies are gas flares. Natural gas is a byproduct of oil drilling and sometimes the gas is burned at the site.
