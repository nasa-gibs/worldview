At night, the true color imagery gives way to infrared (IR)-based blended multispectral imagery that provides differentiation between low liquid water clouds (shown in light blue) and higher ice clouds (shown in gray/white). It also includes a static city lights/night lights database derived from the VIIRS Day/Night Band, which aids in geo-referencing and can help determine the proximity of clouds (such as fog) or weather hazards (such as thunderstorms or tropical cyclones) to population centers. These night lights are static and will not change even if, for example, a weather-induced power outage occurs. This GOES-East image shows Tropical Storm Ida moving inland over portions of southeastern Louisiana, southern Mississippi, and southern Alabama on 30 August 2021, 08:40 UTC/03:40 CDT.
