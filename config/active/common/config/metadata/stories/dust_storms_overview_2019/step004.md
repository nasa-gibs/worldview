Dust from the Gobi Desert in Central Asia is evident in the Aerosol Index layer from the Ozone Mapping and Profiler Suite (OMPS) instrument on the joint NASA/NOAA Suomi NPP satellite. The reds indicate high aerosol index, turn on and off the Aerosol Index layer by clicking on the "eye" icon in the layer list to see the dust in the true color corrected reflectance imagery from VIIRS.
