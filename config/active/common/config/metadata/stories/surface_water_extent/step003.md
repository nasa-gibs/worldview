An intense winter storm fueled by an atmospheric river in late-August 2023 caused the lake to partially refill. The image on the left shows the dried lake bed on 18 May 2023, and the image on the right shows the partially filled lake on 15 September 2023. Swipe the bar back and forth to see the lake fill and turn greenish blue on the right "B" side of the view.
