Each summer, the Indus River Valley receives heavy monsoon rains that contribute to the appearance of extensive surface water. These false-color reflectance HLS images from Landsat 8 show open water in black to dark blue hues. The left image is from 3 May 2023, before the monsoon rains, and the right side is from 7 August 2023, after monsoon rains. Swiping the bar back and forth shows the extent of floodwaters along the riverbanks and in the surrounding region.
