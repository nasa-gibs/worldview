The OPERA water layer highlights the refilled lake in dark blue where open water dominates each satellite measurement, and light blue where the satellite measurement includes mixtures of water, soil, or vegetation referred to as partial surface water. The water layer is designed to improve our understanding of the spatial and temporal variations of land inundation by surface water. It is currently unclear how long this lake will remain filled, but as of 20 December 2023 in the right image, DSWx-HLS indicates the lake water level is slightly higher than at the time of the left image from 15 September.
