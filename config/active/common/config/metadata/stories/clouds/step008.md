The cloud patterns appearing to the south of Guadalupe Island are known as von K&agrave;rm&agrave;n vortices. It occurs when a fluid flow is disturbed by a solid object, like here where winds are routed around the island. The flow slows and creates a vertical wall of whirling air where faster wind flows past slower wind below. These wrap themselves into vortices and alternate off the two sides of the island causing the spiral pattern. Guadalupe Island rises to 1.3 km in elevation and is about 35 km long and located 260 km west of Baja California.
