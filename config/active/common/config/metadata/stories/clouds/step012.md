This image of the fires in southeastern Australia on 4 January 2020 not only show massive smoke plumes, visible in shades of tan, but also bright white clouds within the smoke plumes. These are pyrocumulonimbus or cumulonimbus flammegenitus clouds. Pyrocumulus clouds can first form if fires burn hot enough to create an updraft of superheated, fast-rising air. As the hot air rises and spreads, it cools and causes water vapor to condense and form clouds. Sometimes, these powerful updrafts can create clouds that rise several kilometers into the atmosphere and when they reach the top of the troposphere, turn into thunderstorms where the pyrocumulus becomes pyrocumulonimbus clouds.
