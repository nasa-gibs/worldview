<p>Here you can see sunglint areas roughly in the center of each of these Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor/Terra satellite swaths over the ocean. You may also be wondering what the black areas of missing imagery near the equator are too! This occurs with MODIS/Terra and MODIS/Aqua imagery because the swath width is only 2,330km wide and each subsequent swath does not overlap with the previous swath at the equator.</p>
