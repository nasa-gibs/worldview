<p>When you view similar imagery from a newer sensor/satellite, the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) on the joint NASA/NOAA Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP) satellite, there are no black swath gaps because the swath width is 3,040 km wide which enables ~15% image overlap between consecutive orbits at the equator - but there is still the issue of sunglint!</p>
