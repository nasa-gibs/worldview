Here we see Hurricane Dorian at 18:30 UTC in a Red Visible imagery layer from the geostationary satellite, GOES-East, taken at roughly the same time as the image from the VIIRS instrument. Turn on and off the Red Visible layer to see the VIIRS Corrected Reflectance image underneath. Note the slight apparent shift in the clouds, which may be due to difference in the satellite angle between the polar orbiting and geostationary satellite.

The Red Visible (0.64&mu;m, Band 2) layer is a single band layer from Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) instrument on board the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES)-East. It is mainly used to monitor the evolution of clouds throughout the daylight hours.

The GOES-East satellite is centered on 75.2 degrees W covering the Conterminous US, Canada, Central and South America. Zoom out to see the full disk of imagery. Geostationary satellites are an altitude of approximately 35,800km (22,300 miles) directly over the equator and revolve in the same direction (west to east) that the Earth rotates. This altitude ensures that one orbit takes 24 hours which is the same length of time as the Earth takes to rotate once on its axis.
