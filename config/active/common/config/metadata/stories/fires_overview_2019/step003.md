When you are zoomed in enough on the map, a blue pointer icon will show next to your fire layer. This indicates that you can click on an individual fire point and retrieve information about that fire/thermal anomaly. Try clicking on an orange dot on the map! See detailed descriptions of the attributes for [VIIRS](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/earth-observation-data/near-real-time/firms/v1-vnp14imgt#ed-viirs-375m-attributes) and [MODIS](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/earth-observation-data/near-real-time/firms/c6-mcd14dl#ed-firms-attributes) fire points.
