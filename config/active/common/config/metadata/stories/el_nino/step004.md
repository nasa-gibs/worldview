## What does El Niño impact?

During an El Niño, wetter weather is usually brought to Peru and Chile with drier conditions across the western Pacific.

Additionally, due to warmer SSTs, El Niño also impacts biodiversity and local economies. For example, off the Peruvian 
Coast the upwelling (bottom ocean water rising towards the surface) is weakened due to the warmer waters arriving from 
the western Equatorial Pacific. These warm waters suppress the upwelling responsible for bringing colder nutrient rich 
water to the surface that support increased primary productivity and healthy fisheries. Thus, El Niño has a direct 
negative impact on the fisheries and the economy of Peru. As the 2023 El Niño continues to develop, such impacts may 
be seen across these areas.

January 15th, 2024 in 7-day increments.
