## When was the last El Niño?

As of 2023, the last notable El Niño event was in 2015. Here we can see an SST anomaly comparison between 
October 22nd, 2015 and October 22nd, 2023. Unlike in 2015, when an SST signature known as 
"[The Blob](https://www.nps.gov/articles/theblob.htm)" was present in the northeastern Pacific, 2023 does not appear to 
exhibit the same contemporaneous phenomenon. 

The Blob can be seen in this comparison in the 2015 SST anomaly data as 
warmer than normal SSTs along the North American west coast. The Blob, even though it overlapped with the 2015 El Niño, 
is not an event directly associated with El Niño’s. The 2023 El Niño is an example of that. However, in 2015 together 
with El Niño, it caused significant [impacts](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/feature-story/looking-back-blob-record-warming-drives-unprecedented-ocean-change) across North America.
