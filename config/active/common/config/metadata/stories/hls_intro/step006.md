Another trade-off is with how often the satellite instrument collects imagery over a particular part of the Earth. MODIS has a high temporal revisit period therefore there is near daily coverage of the Earth's surface. MSI, aboard Sentinel 2A and 2B, have a 5 day revisit period and OLI, aboard Landsat, has a 16 day revisit period. Combined together by the HLS project, this equates to near global coverage in 2 to 3 days.
