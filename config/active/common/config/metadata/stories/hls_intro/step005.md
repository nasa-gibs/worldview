For satellite instruments to obtain higher resolution imagery, there are trade-offs to consider. One is the amount of data that can be collected during the satellite overpass. The swath width of the MODIS instrument is 2330 km wide, which you can see here over Australia between the two black swath gaps. The swath width of MSI, aboard Sentinel 2A and 2B, is 290 km visible with the two swaths along the magenta and lime green orbit tracks. The swath width of the OLI instrument, aboard Landsat, (not shown) is 180 km. Use the measurement tool to measure the width of the swaths.
