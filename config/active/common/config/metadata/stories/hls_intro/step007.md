These satellites have a similar overpass time as the Terra satellite (approximately 10:00 - 10:30am local time equatorial crossing), providing continuity to the Terra/MODIS surface reflectance layers. Orbit tracks are shown here from the Landsat 8 satellite in red, Sentinel 2A in magenta and Sentinel 2B in lime green.
