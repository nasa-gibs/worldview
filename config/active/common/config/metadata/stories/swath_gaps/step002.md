<p>This occurs with MODIS/Terra and MODIS/Aqua imagery because the viewing swath width is 2,330km wide. It's like trying to wrap a narrow piece of ribbon that is of a fixed length around an orange from top to bottom (pole to pole) and so that the ribbon covers the entire orange. If the ribbon is too narrow, you will have trouble ensuring that there are no gaps around the middle (or equator) of the orange. </p>
