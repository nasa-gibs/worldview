<p>When you view imagery from the newer sensor/satellite - the joint NASA/NOAA Suomi National Poplar-orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP)/Visibie Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), there are no black swath gaps because the swath width is 3,040 km wide. This enables an approximate 15% image overlap between consecutive orbits at the equator. This "ribbon" is much wider than the MODIS "ribbon".</p>
