The VIIRS Deep Blue Aerosol Type layer provides information related to the aerosol composition over land and ocean.

The Deep Blue (DB) algorithm is employed for over-land use and the Satellite Ocean Aerosol Retrieval (SOAR) algorithm is used over water to determine atmospheric aerosol type for day time cloud-free snow-free scenes. The combined Aerosol Type over land and ocean layer is derived from pixels that pass high-quality assurance tests. Over water, aerosol type is retrieved via the aerosol type optical model that yields the best fit. Over land, aerosol type is classified based on Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD), Ångström exponent, Lambert Equivalent Reflectivity (LER), and brightness temperature.

The VIIRS Deep Blue Aerosol Type layer is available from the joint NASA/NOAA Suomi National Polar orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP) satellite (AERDB_L2_VIIRS_SNPP) for the daytime overpass. The sensor/algorithm resolution is 6 km at nadir, imagery resolution is 2 km at nadir, and the temporal resolution is daily. Resolution is much coarser out toward the edge of the swath.
