The VIIRS Dark Target Aerosol Optical Thickness layer is useful for studying aerosol optical depth over the ocean as well as vegetation/dark-soiled land, which are both dark in the visible wavelengths.

This layer is created from two separate and distinct DT algorithms. One helps retrieve aerosol information over ocean (dark in visible and longer wavelengths), while the second aids retrievals over vegetated/dark-soiled land (dark in the visible).

The VIIRS Dark Target Aerosol Ångström Exponent layer is available from the joint NASA/NOAA Suomi National Polar orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP) satellite (AERDT_L2_VIIRS_SNPP) for the daytime overpass. The sensor/algorithm resolution is 6 km at nadir, imagery resolution is 2 km at nadir, and the temporal resolution is daily. Resolution is much coarser out toward the edge of the swath.
