The AIRS Precipitation Estimate (Night) layer is an estimate of daily precipitation measured in millimeters (mm) using cloud-related parameters of cloud-top pressure, fractional cloud cover, and cloud-layer relative humidity.

The precipitation algorithm is a regression between these parameters and some observed precipitation data. It is an estimate from AIRS using a TOVS-like algorithm and is intended for merging into the precipitation product of the Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP).
