The Cloud Top Height (L2, Day) layer is the log-pressure altitude calculated from the retrieved AIRS cloud top pressure assuming a surface pressure of 1000 hPa and a scale height of 6 kilometers. These are the approximate altitudes where clouds have infrared optical depths of unity. AIRS can sense up to two cloud decks in a column of atmosphere, but in this plot only the higher of the two decks is depicted.

#### Image Resolution
32 km/pixel (AIRS Level 2 `PCldTopStd` is nominally 13.5km/pixel, the data has been resampled into a 32 km/pixel visualization.)
