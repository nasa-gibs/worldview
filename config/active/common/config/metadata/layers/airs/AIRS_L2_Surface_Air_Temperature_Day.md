#### Description
Temperature of the air in units of Kelvin (K) two meters above sea level. Near-surface air temperature is an essential climate variable widely used in studies of meteorology, climate, and environmental health applications.

#### Image Resolution
32 km/pixel (AIRS Level 2 data is nominally 45 km/pixel at the equator and the data has been resampled into a 32 km/pixel visualization.)

#### Data Product
Image initially produced with NRT data. Science quality image replaces NRT when available.<br>
Near Real-Time Product: `AIRS2RET_NRT` (AIRS-Only Level 2 Near Real-Time Product Version 7)<br>
Science Quality Product: `AIRS2RET` (AIRS-Only Level 2 Standard Product Version 6)<br>
Field name: `TSurfAir`<br>
Resolution: 45 km/pixel at nadir

#### Coverage
Spatial Coverage: Global<br>
Overpasses: Twice daily (day and night)<br>
Orbit: Sun-synchronous polar; Equatorial crossing local time: Daytime 1:30 pm, Nighttime 1:30 am
