The AIRS Prata SO2 Index (Night) layer indicates Sulfur Dioxide column amounts in the atmosphere, measured in Dobson Units (DU). The AIRS Sulfur Dioxide Index Prata algorithm was authored by Fred Prata from the Norwegian Institute for Air Research.

The Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) is an instrument on board the Aqua satellite. The AIRS Prata SO2 Index science parameter is a derived parameter from the Level 1B Near-Real Time Infrared (IR) geolocated and calibrated radiances, (AIRIBRAD_NRT). The imagery resolution is 2 km and sensor resolution is 45 km. The temporal resolution is daily.
