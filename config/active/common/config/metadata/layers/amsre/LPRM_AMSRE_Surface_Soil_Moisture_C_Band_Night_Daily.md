The Surface Soil Moisture C-band (Night, Daily) layer displays level 3, daily, gridded surface soil moisture from the nighttime (descending) overpass. The surface soil moisture is derived from passive microwave remote sensing data from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-Earth Observing System (AMSR-E), using the Land Parameter Retrieval Model (LPRM). The LPRM is based on a forward radiative transfer model to retrieve surface soil moisture and vegetation optical depth.

The spatial resolution is 25 km x 25 km, the imagery resolution is 2 km and temporal availability is daily, covering the period from June 2002 to October 2011.
