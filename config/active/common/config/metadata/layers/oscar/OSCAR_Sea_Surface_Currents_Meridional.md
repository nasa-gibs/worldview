The Sea Surface Currents (Meridional) layer is from the Ocean Surface Current Analyses Real-time (OSCAR), a global surface current database and NASA funded research project. OSCAR ocean mixed layer velocities are calculated from satellite-sensed sea surface height gradients, ocean vector winds, and sea surface temperature gradients using a simplified physical model for geostrophy, Ekman, and thermal wind dynamics. Daily averaged surface currents are provided on a global 0.25 x 0.25 degree grid as an average over an assumed well-mixed top 30 m of the ocean from 1993 to present day. OSCAR is generated by [Earth & Space Research (ESR)](https://www.esr.org/research/oscar/).
