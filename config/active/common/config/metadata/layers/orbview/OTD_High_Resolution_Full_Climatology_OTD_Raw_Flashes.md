The OrbView-1/OTD Lightning Flashes (Raw) layer indicates the average number of total raw lightning flashes from 4 May 1995 to 31 December 2013. The imagery resolution is 3 to 6 kilometers and is available as a single layer for viewing in Worldview/Global Imagery Browse Services (GIBS). This layer was constructed through the detection of total lightning occurring in the Earthâ€™s tropical and subtropical regions by the Optical Transient Detector (OTD) instrument on the OrbView-1 satellite.

The OTD instrument detects both intra-cloud and cloud-to-ground lightning discharges during day and night conditions with a high detection efficiency. The OTD located the lightning discharges that occurred within its field-of-view and marked the time of occurrence of the lightning.
