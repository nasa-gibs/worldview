The Calibrated Flash Radiance (OTD/Microlab-1) layer displays radiance of lightning flashes measured in &mu;J/sr/m<sup>2</sup>/&mu;m as recorded by the Optical Transient Detector (OTD).

The Optical Transient Detector (OTD) records optical measurements of global lightning events in the daytime and nighttime. The data includes individual point (lightning) data, satellite metadata, and several derived products. The OTD was launched on 3 April 1995 aboard the Microlab-1 satellite into a near polar orbit with an inclination of 70 degrees with respect to the equator, at an altitude of 740 km.
