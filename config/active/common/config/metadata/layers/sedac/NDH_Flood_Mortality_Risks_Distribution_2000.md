The Flood Hazard: Mortality Risk layer indicates the global flood mortality risks and distribution between 1985 and 2003. The information displayed in Worldview/Global Imagery Browse Services (GIBS) reflects the decile within which the risk lies, ranging from low to high mortality risk: 1st to 10th decile.

Global Flood Mortality Risks and Distribution is a 2.5 minute grid of global flood mortality risks. Gridded Population of the World, Version 3 (GPWv3) data provided a baseline population per grid cell from which to estimate potential mortality risks due to flood hazard. Mortality loss estimates per flood event are calculated using regional, hazard-specific mortality records of the Emergency Events Database (EM-DAT) that span the 20 years between 1981 and 2000. Data regarding the frequency and distribution of flood hazard are obtained from the Global Flood Hazard Frequency and Distribution data set. In order to more accurately reflect the confidence associated with the data and the procedures, the potential mortality estimate range is classified into deciles, 10 classes of increasing hazard with an approximately equal number of grid cells per class, producing a relative estimate of flood-based mortality risks.
