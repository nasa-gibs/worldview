The Brightness Temperature (Channel 06) displays brightness temperature in Kelvin (K).

The Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit, (AMSU-A), is a cross-track, line-scanning instrument designed to measure scene radiances in 15 discrete frequency channels which permit the calculation of the vertical temperature and moisture profile from about 3 millibars (~45 km) to the Earth's surface. AMSU flies on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) polar orbiting spacecraft as part of the National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS). NOAA-15 was the first spacecraft to fly AMSU. Launched on 13 May 1998, NOAA-15 is in a sun synchronous near polar orbit. Channel 11 has an end date of 10 April 2002 and channel 14 has an end date of 30 October 2002 due to failures with those two channels.

The spatial resolution is 3.3 degrees (50 km at nadir), imagery resolution is 2 km and temporal availability is daily.
