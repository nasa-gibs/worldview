The Brightness Temperature (Channel 03) displays brightness temperature in Kelvin (K).

The Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit, (AMSU-A), is a cross-track, line-scanning instrument designed to measure scene radiances in 15 discrete frequency channels which permit the calculation of the vertical temperature and moisture profile from about 3 millibars (~45 km) to the Earth's surface. AMSU flies on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) polar orbiting spacecraft as part of the National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS). The Third Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit-A was launched on NOAA-17 on 24 June 2002. NOAA-17 AMSU-A1 suffered an instrument failure on 28 October 2003.

The spatial resolution is 3.3 degrees (50 km at nadir), imagery resolution is 2 km and temporal availability is daily.
