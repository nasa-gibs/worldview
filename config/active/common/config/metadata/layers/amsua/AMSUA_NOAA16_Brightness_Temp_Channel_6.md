The Brightness Temperature (Channel 06) displays brightness temperature in Kelvin (K).

The Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit, (AMSU-A), is a cross-track, line-scanning instrument designed to measure scene radiances in 15 discrete frequency channels which permit the calculation of the vertical temperature and moisture profile from about 3 millibars (~45 km) to the Earth's surface. AMSU flies on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) polar orbiting spacecraft as part of the National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS). Launched on 21 September 2000, NOAA-16 is in a sun synchronous near polar orbit. NOAA-16 AMSU-A1 - Channel 4 out of spec performance was confirmed on 4 March 2008. This channel is used for limb correction, and this failure requires GHRC to discontinue the AMSUA16 swath products. This dataset has an end date of 3 March 2008.

The spatial resolution is 3.3 degrees (50 km at nadir), imagery resolution is 2 km and temporal availability is daily.
