The Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) "Uncorrected Brightness Temperature 36 km QA‚Äù layers displays quality assurance (QA) flags for uncorrected brightness temperatures (TBs) on a 36 km EASE-Grid 2.0 for the horizontal (H) polarization of the fore scan from the SMAP radiometer.

Within the image, green indicates that TB observations have acceptable quality for science use, yellow indicates that caution should be used with the TB observations as one or more quality-impacting conditions have been identified, and red indicates that TB observations are flagged as bad due to unacceptable quality.
