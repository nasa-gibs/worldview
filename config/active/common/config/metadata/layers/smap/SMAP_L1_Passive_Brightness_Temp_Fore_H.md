The Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) "Uncorrected Brightness Temperature 36 km" layer displays brightness temperatures (TBs) posted to a 36 km EASE-Grid 2.0 and uncorrected for the presence of water in Kelvin (K) for the horizontal (H) polarization of the fore scan from the SMAP radiometer. At the L-band frequency used by SMAP, the TB of the land surface is proportional to its emissivity multiplied by its physical temperature.

The SMAP spacecraft carries two instruments, a radar (active) and a radiometer (passive), that together make global measurements of land surface soil moisture and freeze/thaw state. It is useful for monitoring and predicting natural hazards such as floods and droughts, understanding the linkages between Earthâ€™s water, energy and carbon cycles, and reducing uncertainties in predicting weather and climate.
