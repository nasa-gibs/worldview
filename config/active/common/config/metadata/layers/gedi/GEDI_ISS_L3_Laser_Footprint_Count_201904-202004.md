The Valid Laser Footprint Count (L3, v1, 2019 APR to 2020 APR) layer shows the number of valid laser footprints per 1 km x 1 km grid cell. This layer is from the version 1, initial release of the GEDI L3 gridded land surface metrics data, covering the period between the 19th and the 70th mission weeks (2019-04-18 to 2020-04-15). It is derived from the GEDI L2 version 1 geolocated laser footprints metric data products. The imagery resolution is 1 km and is available globally within -52 and 52 degrees latitude.
