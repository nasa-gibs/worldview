The Canopy Height Standard Deviation (L3, v1, 2019 APR to 2020 APR) layer is the standard deviation of RH100 for all valid footprints per 1 km x 1 km grid cell. RH100 or relative height is the 100th percentile of waveform energy relative to ground elevation. This layer is from the version 1, initial release of the Global Elevation Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) L3 gridded land surface metrics data, covering the period between the 19th and the 70th mission weeks (2019-04-18 to 2020-04-15). It is derived from the L2B version 1 geolocated laser footprints metric data product. The imagery resolution is 1km and is available globally within -52 and 52 degrees latitude.
