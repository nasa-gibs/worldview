The Aboveground Biomass Density Standard Error (L4B, v2, 2019 APR to 2021 AUG) layer is the standard error of the mean estimate of aboveground biomass density, combining sampling and modeling uncertainty, within the 1 km x 1 km grid cell. This layer is from the version 2 release of the Global Elevation Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) L4B gridded aboveground biomass density data covering the period between the 19th and the 138th mission weeks (2019-04-18 to 2021-08-04). The imagery resolution is 1km and is available globally within -52 and 52 degrees latitude.
