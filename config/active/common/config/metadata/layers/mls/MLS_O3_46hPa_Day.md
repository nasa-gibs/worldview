The Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) Ozone (O3) Mixing Ratio layer at 46hPa (hectopascals) indicates ozone levels at the vertical atmospheric pressure level of 46hPa, and is measured in parts per billion by volume (ppbv).

The MLS Ozone (O3) Mixing Ratio 46hPa layer is derived from the MLS Ozone product (ML2O3_NRT) available from the Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) instrument on the Aura satellite. The sensor resolution is 5 km, imagery resolution is 2 km, and the temporal resolution is daily.
