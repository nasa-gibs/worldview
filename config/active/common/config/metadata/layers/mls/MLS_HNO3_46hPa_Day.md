The Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) Nitric Acid (46hPa, Day) layer shows nitric acid (HNO3) mixing ratio levels at the vertical atmospheric pressure level 46hPa (hectopascals), and is measured in parts per billion by volume (ppbv).

The MLS Nitric Acid (HNO3) Mixing Ratio at 46hPa layer is derived from the MLS Nitric Acid (ML2HNO3_NRT) available from the Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) instrument on the Aura satellite. The sensor resolution is 5 km, imagery resolution is 2 km, and the temporal resolution is daily.
