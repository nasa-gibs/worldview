### About Water Vapor
Almost all of atmospheric moisture is in the form of water vapor. This water vapor drives the development of weather systems on short time scales and influences the climate on longer time scales. Water vapor is Earthâ€™s primary greenhouse gas and traps more heat than carbon dioxide. The movement of water vapor around the globe helps determine the amount of precipitation a region might receive and helps transport heat from the tropics to the poles.
