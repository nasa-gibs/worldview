The OCO-2 Solar Induced Chlorophyll Fluorescence (Blended) layer displays the fluorescence emission from land surfaces derived from in-filling of solar Fraunhofer lines at the 757 nm and 771 nm regions of the measured spectrum.

One of the OCO-2 channels, the O<sub>2</sub> A-band, contains multiple Fraunhofer lines and thus allows for the retrieval of SIF. The absorption at 771 nm is about 1.5 times smaller than at 757 nm, but both values are made available for analysis. However, the blended SIF is the recommended product. The OCO-2 Solar Induced Chlorophyll Fluorescence 771 nm parameter is taken from the OCO-2 Level 2 Lite SIF product. OCO-2 makes eight simultaneous, adjacent measurements, each with a spatial resolution of 2.25 km x 1.29 km. These measurements are then mapped onto a 500 m<sup>2</sup> grid. The repeat cycle for OCO-2 is every 16 days.
