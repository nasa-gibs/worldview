The OCO-2 Water Vapor (Total Column Average) layer displays the total gaseous water within a vertical column of the atmosphere over land and ocean and is measured in millimeters (mm). Water vapor (H<sub>2</sub>O) is one of the retrieved variables in the OCO-2 retrieval algorithm.

The OCO-2 Total Column Water Vapor is an ancillary product of the retrieval algorithm used to measure the CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations derived from the OCO-2 Level 2 Lite product. OCO-2 makes eight simultaneous, adjacent measurements, each with a spatial resolution of 2.25 km x 1.29 km. These measurements are then mapped onto a 500 m<sup>2</sup> grid. The repeat cycle for OCO-2 is every 16 days.
