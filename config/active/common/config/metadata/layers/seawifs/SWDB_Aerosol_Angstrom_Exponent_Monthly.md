The Aerosol Angstrom Exponent (Monthly) layer can be used to provide additional information on the aerosol particle size over land and ocean. The Ångström exponent provides additional information on the particle size (larger the exponent, the smaller the particle size). Values < 1 suggest optical dominance of coarse particles (e.g. dust) and values > 1 suggest optical dominance of fine particles (e.g. smoke).

The layer is from the SeaWiFS Deep Blue (SWDB) Level 3 daily global gridded (0.5 x 0.5 deg) data which is derived from SeaWiFS Deep Blue Level 2 data. The sensor resolution is 0.5 degrees, imagery resolution is 2 km and is available monthly.
