The Tropospheric Emissions: Monitoring of Pollution (TEMPO) Level 3 (L3) Cloud Pressure layer provides information on the optical centroid pressure of clouds derived using the O<sub>2</sub>-O<sub>2</sub> cloud retrieval algorithm and is measured in hectopascals (hPa).

Imagery is available as approximately one-hour scans for daylight hours over North America. The sensor’s native spatial resolution is ~2 km x 4.75 km at the center of TEMPO’s field of regard (FOR), the Level 3 product resolution is 0.02 x 0.02 degrees, and the imagery resolution is 2 km. The layer is filtered to display high-quality pixels with solar zenith angles less than 80 degrees.

O<sub>2</sub>-O<sub>2</sub> cloud Level 3 files provide cloud information on a regular grid. Level 3 files are derived by combining information from all Level 2 files constituting a TEMPO East-West scan cycle, using an area-weighted re-gridding approach. The temporal resolution of a nominal scan is approximately one hour during daylight hours, with more frequent scans in the morning over the eastern portion of the FOR and in the evenings over the western portion of the FOR.
