The OMI Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) tropospheric parameter displays the tropospheric component of the total NO2 column measured in molecules/cm<sup>2</sup>.

The Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) Level-3 NO2 (OMNO2d) product provides daily gridded global coverage with a temporal resolution of 1 day, imagery resolution of 2 km and sensor/algorithm resolution where pixel level data of good quality are binned and "averaged" into 0.25 x 0.25 degree global grids.
