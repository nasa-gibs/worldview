The OMI Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) Planetary Boundary Layer (PBL) indicates the column density of sulfur dioxide in the tropospheric boundary-layer (corresponding to the center of mass altitude (CMA) of 0.9 km) and is measured in Dobson Units (DU). It is one of the parameters contained in the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) Level-3 SO2 (OMSO2e) product.

The OMSO2e product provides daily gridded global coverage with a temporal resolution of 1 day, imagery resolution of 2 km, and sensor/algorithm resolution of 0.25 x 0.25 degrees.
