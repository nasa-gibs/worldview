The meridional wind vector layer was original produced by the MEaSUREs Cross-Calibrated Multi-Platform (CCMP) project and derived using satellite inputs coupled with a background analysis wind field from ECMWF to produce a monthly mean wind product that represents inputs of actual observations to represent a continuous observational data record from July 1987 through December 2011. Spatial coverage is global, and extends to approximately 78 degrees North and South latitude.
