The Sea Surface Height Anomalies (L4) layer show gridded Sea Surface Height Anomalies (SSHA) above a mean sea surface, on 1/6th degree grid every 5 days. It contains the fully corrected heights, but delayed 3 months.

The gridded data are derived from the SSHA data of TOPEX/Poseidon, Jason-1, Jason-2 and Jason-3 as reference data from the level 2 swath data found on the [PO.DAAC website](https://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/dataset/MERGED_TP_J1_OSTM_OST_CYCLES_V42), plus ERS-1, ERS-2, Envisat, SARAL-AltiKa, CRyosat-2, depending on the date, from the RADS database. The gridding is done by the kriging method. The date given in the data is the center of the 5 day window.
