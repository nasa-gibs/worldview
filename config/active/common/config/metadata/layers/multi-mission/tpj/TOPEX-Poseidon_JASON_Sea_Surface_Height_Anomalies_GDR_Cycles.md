The Sea Surface Height Anomalies (GDR Cycles) layer is a part of the Integrated Multi-Mission Ocean Altimeter Data for Climate Research dataset which contains along track geo-referenced Sea Surface Height Anomalies (SSHA) from TOPEX/Poseidon, Jason-1 and OSTM/Jason-2 (depending on time period) merged into a single mean reference orbit.  All biases and cross-calibrations have been applied to the data so SSHA are consistent between satellites to form a single climate data record.  Altimeter data from the multi-mission Geophysical Data Records (GDRs) are interpolated to a common reference orbit facilitating direct time series analysis of the geo-referenced SSH.  The data are in netCDF format. Each file consists of one cycle of data, which is approximately 10 days long.  Cycle 001 coincides with cycle 001 of TOPEX/Poseidon (September 25-October 3, 1992).
