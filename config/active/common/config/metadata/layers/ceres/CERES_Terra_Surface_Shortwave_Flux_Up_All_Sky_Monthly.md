The Untuned Shortwave Surface Flux (Monthly, Up, All-Sky) layer shows CERES-observed temporally interpolated and spatially gridded surface incoming and outgoing observed flux or radiance (W/m<sup>2</sup>) contained within the SYN1deg product, which is a primary input to the EBAF product. This layer is for the shortwave (0.2-5 Âµm) broadband channel under all-sky conditions. CERES footprints (20 km nominal resolution) are classified as clear if they contain 99% of pixels identified as clear by the CERES-MODIS clear-sky mask.

The Untuned Shortwave Surface Flux (Monthly, Up, All-Sky) layer is available from the CERES instruments on the Terra satellite. The sensor resolution is 1 degree, imagery resolution is 2 km, and the temporal resolution is monthly.
