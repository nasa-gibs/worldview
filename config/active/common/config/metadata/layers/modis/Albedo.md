### MODIS (Terra and Aqua) White Sky Albedo (Level 3, Daily)
Temporal coverage: 18 May 2000 - present

The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) MCD43A3 Version 6 Albedo Model dataset is produced daily using 16 days of Terra and Aqua MODIS data at 500 meter (m) resolution. Data are temporally weighted to the ninth day of the 16 day which is reflected in the Julian date in the file name.

The MCD43A3 provides black-sky albedo (directional hemispherical reflectance) and white-sky albedo (bihemispherical reflectance) data at local solar noon. The White Sky Albedo layer is a representation of white-sky albedo for the shortwave broadband.
