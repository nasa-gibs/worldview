The Land Surface Temperature (L3, Monthly, Night) layer shows monthly, night time land surface temperature in Kelvin (K). It is created from the MOD11C3 product provides monthly Land Surface Temperature and Emissivity (LST&E) values in a 0.05 degree (5,600 meters at the equator) latitude/longitude Climate Modeling Grid (CMG). A CMG granule is a geographic grid with 7,200 columns and 3,600 rows representing the entire globe. The LST&E values in the MOD11C3 product are derived by compositing and averaging the values from the corresponding month of the Terra MODIS LST&E daily files. The Land Surface Temperature layer is a representation of nighttime LST.
