The MODIS/Aqua Sea Ice Extent Daily layer shows the daily, daytime presence of sea ice in 1 km tiles. Sea ice is obtained from the MODIS/Aqua Sea Ice Extent 5-Min L2 Swath 1km, Version 6 (MYD29) data set. Each MYD29P1D tile consists of the best sea ice swath observation of the day selected from MYD29. Sea ice is detected using the Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI) snow cover algorithm. The algorithm assumes that sea ice is snow-covered and that the NDSI can be used to detect sea ice. Sea ice detection is constrained to daylight ocean pixels that have visible reflectance above 10 percent and are not obstructed by clouds.

The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) is a 36-band visible to thermal-infrared sensor onboard the Terra and Aqua satellites. Two of the bands are imaged at a nominal resolution of 250 m at nadir, five bands at 500 m, and the remaining bands at 1000 m.

Sea Ice data is useful for marine navigation, environmental monitoring, and climate forecasting.
