The Land Surface Temperature (L3, Monthly, Day) layer is created from the MYD11C3 product which provides monthly Land Surface Temperature and Emissivity (LST&E) values in a 0.05 degree (5,600 meters at the equator) latitude/longitude Climate Modeling Grid (CMG). A CMG granule is a geographic grid with 7,200 columns and 3,600 rows representing the entire globe. The LST&E values in the MYD11C3 product are derived by compositing and averaging the values from the corresponding month of Aqua MODIS LST&E daily files. The Land Surface Temperature Day layer is a representation of daytime LST.
