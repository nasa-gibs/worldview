The MAIAC Aerosol Optical Depth layer is from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) combined Terra and Aqua Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) Land Aerosol Optical Depth level 2 product.

Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) is a vertically integrated extinction by aerosol particles suspended in the atmosphere. Aerosols absorb and scatter incoming sunlight, which reduces visibility and increases the optical depth. Aerosols affect human health, weather and climate.

The MAIAC Combined Aerosol Optical Depth layer is available as a combined Terra satellite and Aqua satellite layer (MCD19A2). The sensor resolution is 1 km, imagery resolution is 1 km, and the temporal resolution is daily.
