### ASTER Global Digital Elevation Model (GDEM) Color Index
The ASTER Global Digital Elevation Model (GDEM) Color Index layer shows land elevation around the world, measured in meters. On the default palette, white indicates the highest elevations, then brown, yellow and greens indicate low elevations.

The Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) instrument is on board the Terra satellite. The ASTER GDEM (version 2) is a static product. It was created from approximately  1.5 million scenes (ASTER stereo pair observations) dating back to 2000 and covers land surfaces between 83°N and 83°S. ASTER GDEM data have a resolution of 30 meters.

### ASTER Global Digital Elevation Model (GDEM) Color Shaded Relief
The ASTER Global Digital Elevation Model (GDEM) Color Shaded Relief layer shows surface elevation as shaded relief in color. Features such as mountains, valleys, plateaus and canyons with steep slopes will appear more rough, while flat areas will appear more smooth. Areas of lower elevation appear darker green, and areas of higher elevation are reds to white. Areas below sea level are a flat grey.

### ASTER Global Digital Elevation Model (GDEM) Greyscale Shaded Relief 
The ASTER Global Digital Elevation Model (GDEM) Greyscale Shaded Relief layer shows surface elevation as shaded relief in shades of grey. Features such as mountains, valleys, plateaus and canyons with steep slopes will appear more rough, while flat areas will appear more smooth.
