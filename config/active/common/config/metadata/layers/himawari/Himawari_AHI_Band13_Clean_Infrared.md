Note: This layer is generally available for the **most recent 30 days**, though certain historical ranges are also preserved.

The Clean Infrared (10.3 um, Band 13) layer from the Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) is useful for detecting clouds all times of day and night and is quite useful in retrievals of cloud top height. It is used to identify and classify cloud and other atmospheric features, estimate cloud-top brightness temperature and cloud particle size, convective severe weather signatures, and hurricane intensity. This infrared window is not strongly affected by atmospheric water vapor.

The Himawari-8 satellite is centered on 140.7 degrees E, covering most of the Pacific Ocean, a portion of Eastern Asia, and parts of Australasia. The Himawari-8 AHI imagery is available on a rolling 30-day basis at 10 minute intervals. The sensor resolution is 2 km, the imagery resolution in Worldview/Global Imagery Browse Services (GIBS) is 2 km and the temporal resolution is 10 minutes.
