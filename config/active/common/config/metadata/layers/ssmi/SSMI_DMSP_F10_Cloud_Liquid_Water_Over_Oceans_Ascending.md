The DMSP-F10 SSMI Cloud Liquid Water Over Oceans layer indicates the amount of cloud liquid water in kilograms per meters squared over oceans. The imagery resolution is about 0.25 degrees, or about 28 kilometers, and the temporal resolution is daily. This is available in two layers, ascending, local PM and descending, local AM. This layer was constructed by the Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) sensor that flew on the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) F10 spacecraft using a unified, physically based algorithm to retrieve cloud liquid water measurements.

The F10 spacecraft is flown by the DMSP on two operational polar orbiting platforms and had an orbit that was near-circular, sun-synchronous, and near-polar with an altitude of about 790 kilometers. The SSM/I sensor consisted of 7 separate total-power radiometers measuring the intensity of radiation coming from its Earth-viewing reflector operating at four different frequencies: 19.35, 22.235, 37, and 85.5 gigahertz.
