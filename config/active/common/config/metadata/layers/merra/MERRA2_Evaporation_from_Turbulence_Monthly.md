The Evaporation from Turbulence (Monthly) layer is created from the M2TMNXINT (or tavgM_2d_int_Nx) data collection. M2TMNXINT is a time-averaged 2-dimensional monthly mean data collection in Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications version 2 (MERRA-2). This collection consists of water and energy related vertically Integrated diagnostics, such as autoconversion loss of cloud water, convective source of cloud ice (water), eastward (nothward) flux of atmospheric ice (liquid, vapor), total potential energy tendency, vertically integrated potential energy tendency, and vertically integrated kinetic energy tendency. The collection also includes variance of certain parameters. MERRA-2 is the latest version of global atmospheric reanalysis for the satellite era produced by NASA Global Modeling and Assimilation Office (GMAO) using the Goddard Earth Observing System Model (GEOS) version 5.12.4.
