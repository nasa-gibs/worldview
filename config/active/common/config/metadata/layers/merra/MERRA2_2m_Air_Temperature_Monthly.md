The 2-meter Air Temperature (Monthly) layer is created from the M2TMNXSLV (or tavgM_2d_slv_Nx) data collection. M2TMNXSLV is a time-averaged 2-dimensional monthly mean data collection in Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications version 2 (MERRA-2). This collection consists of meteorology diagnostics at popularly used vertical levels, such as air temperature at 2-meter (or at 10-meter, 850hPa, 500 hPa, 250hPa), wind components at 50-meter (or at 2-meter, 10-meter, 850hPa, 500hPa, 250 hPa), sea level pressure, surface pressure, and total precipitable water vapor (or ice water, liquid water). The collection also includes variance of certain parameters. MERRA-2 is the latest version of global atmospheric reanalysis for the satellite era produced by NASA Global Modeling and Assimilation Office (GMAO) using the Goddard Earth Observing System Model (GEOS) version 5.12.4.
