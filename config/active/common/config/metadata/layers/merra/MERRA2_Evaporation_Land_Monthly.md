The Evaporation over Land (Monthly) layer is created from the M2TMNXLND (or tavgM_2d_lnd_Nx) data collection. M2TMNXLND is a time-averaged 2-dimensional monthly mean data collection in Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications version 2 (MERRA-2). This collection consists of land surface diagnostics, such as baseflow flux, runoff, surface soil wetness, root zone soil wetness, water at surface layer, water at root zone layer, and soil temperature at six layers. The collection also includes variance of certain parameters. MERRA-2 is the latest version of global atmospheric reanalysis for the satellite era produced by NASA Global Modeling and Assimilation Office (GMAO) using the Goddard Earth Observing System Model (GEOS) version 5.12.4.
