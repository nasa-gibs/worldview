The Total Dust Deposition, Dry+Wet All Bins (Monthly) layer is created from the M2TMNXADG (or tavgM_2d_adg_Nx) data collection. M2TMNXADG is a time-averaged 2-dimensional monthly mean data collection in Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications version 2 (MERRA-2). This collection consists of assimilated aerosol diagnostics (extended), such as dry and wet deposition of each aerosol component, dust emission and sedimentation for each sized bin, and organic carbon convective scavenging. The collection also includes variance of certain parameters. MERRA-2 is the latest version of global atmospheric reanalysis for the satellite era produced by NASA Global Modeling and Assimilation Office (GMAO) using the Goddard Earth Observing System Model (GEOS) version 5.12.4.
