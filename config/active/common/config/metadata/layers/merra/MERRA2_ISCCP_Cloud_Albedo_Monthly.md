The ISCCP Cloud Albedo (Monthly) layer is created from the M2TMNXCSP (or tavgM_2d_csp_Nx), a time-averaged 2-dimensional monthly mean data collection in Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications version 2 (MERRA-2). This data collection consists of parameters from Cloud Feedback Model Intercomparison Project (CFMIP) Observations Simulator Package (COSP), such as International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) total cloud area fraction, MODIS cloud fraction water (ice) mean, MODIS cloud fraction low (mid,high) mean, MODIS cloud particle size water (ice) mean. The collection also includes variance of certain parameters. MERRA-2 is the latest version of global atmospheric reanalysis for the satellite era produced by NASA Global Modeling and Assimilation Office (GMAO) using the Goddard Earth Observing System Model (GEOS) version 5.12.4. The dataset covers the period of 1980-present with the latency of ~3 weeks after the end of a month.
