The MERRA-2 Surface Albedo (Monthly) layer is created from the M2TMNXRAD (or tavgM_2d_rad_Nx) data collection. M2TMNXRAD is a time-averaged 2-dimensional monthly mean data collection in Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications version 2 (MERRA-2). This collection consists of radiation diagnostics, such as surface albedo, cloud area fraction, in cloud optical thickness, surface incoming shortwave flux (i.e. solar radiation), surface net downward shortwave flux, and upwelling longwave flux at toa (top of atmosphere) (i.e. outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) at toa). The collection also includes variance of certain parameters. MERRA-2 is the latest version of global atmospheric reanalysis for the satellite era produced by NASA Global Modeling and Assimilation Office (GMAO) using the Goddard Earth Observing System Model (GEOS) version 5.12.4.
