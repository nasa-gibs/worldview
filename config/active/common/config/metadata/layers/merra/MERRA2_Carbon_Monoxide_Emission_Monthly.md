The Carbon Monoxide Emission ENSEMBLE (Monthly) layer is created from M2TMNXCHM (or tavgM_2d_chm_Nx), a time-averaged 2-dimensional monthly mean data collection in Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications version 2 (MERRA-2. This data collection consists of assimilated carbon monoxide and ozone diagnostics, such as properties of carbon monoxide (column burden, emission, chemical production, and surface concentration), and total column ozone. The collection also includes variance of certain parameters. MERRA-2 is the latest version of global atmospheric reanalysis for the satellite era produced by NASA Global Modeling and Assimilation Office (GMAO) using the Goddard Earth Observing System Model (GEOS) version 5.12.4. The dataset covers the period of 1980-present with the latency of ~3 weeks after the end of a month.
