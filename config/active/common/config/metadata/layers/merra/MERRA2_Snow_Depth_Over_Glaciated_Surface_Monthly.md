The Snow Depth Over Glaciated Surface (Monthly) layer is created from the M2TMNXGLC data collection. M2TMNXGLC (or tavgM_2d_glc_Nx) is a 2-dimensional monthly mean data collection in Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications version 2 (MERRA-2). This collection consists of assimilated land ice surface diagnostics at the single levels, such as fractional area of glaciated surface snow cover, snow mass over glaciated surface, snow depth over glaciated surface, and total snow mass residual due to densification. The collection also includes variance of certain parameters. MERRA-2 is the latest version of global atmospheric reanalysis for the satellite era produced by NASA Global Modeling and Assimilation Office (GMAO) using the Goddard Earth Observing System Model (GEOS) version 5.12.4.
