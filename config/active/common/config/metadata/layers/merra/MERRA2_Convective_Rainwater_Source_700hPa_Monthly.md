The Convective Rainwater Source at 700hPa (Monthly) layer is created from the M2TMNPMST data collection. M2TMNPMST (or tavgM_3d_mst_Np) is a 3-dimensional monthly mean data collection in Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications version 2 (MERRA-2). This collection consists of assimilations of moist processes diagnostics on the 42 pressure levels, such as convective rainwater source, 3D flux of ice convective (or nonconvective) precipitation, and 3D flux of liquid convective (or nonconvective) precipitation. The information on the pressure levels can be found in the section 4.2 of the MERRA-2 File Specification document. The collection also includes variance of certain parameters. MERRA-2 is the latest version of global atmospheric reanalysis for the satellite era produced by NASA Global Modeling and Assimilation Office (GMAO) using the Goddard Earth Observing System Model (GEOS) version 5.12.4.
