The Relative Humidity After Moist at 700hPa (Monthly) layer is created from the M2TMNPCLD (or tavgM_3d_cld_Np) data collection. M2TMNPCLD is a 3-dimensional monthly mean data collection in Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications version 2 (MERRA-2). This collection consists of assimilations of cloud diagnostics on 42 pressure levels, such as updraft areal fraction, cloud fraction for radiation, in-cloud cloud liquid (or ice) for radiation, and mass fraction of cloud liquid (or ice) water. The information on the pressure levels can be found in the section 4.2 of the MERRA-2 File Specification document. The collection also includes variance of certain parameters. MERRA-2 is the latest version of global atmospheric reanalysis for the satellite era produced by NASA Global Modeling and Assimilation Office (GMAO) using the Goddard Earth Observing System Model (GEOS) version 5.12.4.
