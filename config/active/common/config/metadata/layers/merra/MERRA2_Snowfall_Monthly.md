The Snowfall (Monthly) layer is created from the M2TMNXFLX (or tavgM_2d_flx_Nx) data collection. M2TMNXFLX is a time-averaged 2-dimensional monthly mean data collection in Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications version 2 (MERRA-2). This collection consists of assimilated surface flux diagnostics, such as total precipitation, bias corrected total precipitation, surface air temperature, surface specific humidity, surface wind speed, and evaporation from turbulence. The “surface” in this data collection is the model surface layer. The heights of the model surface layer (HLML) vary with time and location, with the value of ~60 meter above ground. The collection also includes variance of certain parameters. MERRA-2 is the latest version of global atmospheric reanalysis for the satellite era produced by NASA Global Modeling and Assimilation Office (GMAO) using the Goddard Earth Observing System Model (GEOS) version 5.12.4.
