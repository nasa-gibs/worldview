The Total Precipitable Water Vapor (Monthly) layer is created from the M2IMNXINT (or instM_2d_int_Nx) data collection, with units reported in kilograms per square meter (kg/m<sup>2</sup>). M2IMNXINT is an instantaneous 2-dimensional monthly mean data collection in Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications version 2 (MERRA-2). This collection consists of vertically integrated diagnostics, such as kinetic energy, virtual potential temperature, and total precipitable water (or ice, liquid, and vapor). The collection also includes variance of certain variables. MERRA-2 is the latest version of global atmospheric reanalysis for the satellite era produced by NASA Global Modeling and Assimilation Office (GMAO) using the Goddard Earth Observing System Model (GEOS) version 5.12.4.
