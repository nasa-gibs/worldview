The Surface Wind Speed (Monthly) layer is created from the M2IMNXLFO data collection. M2IMNXLFO (or instM_2d_lfo_Nx) is an instantaneous 2-dimensional monthly mean data collection in Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications version 2 (MERRA-2). This collection consists of land surface forcing parameters, such as height, specific humidity, wind, and air temperature of the model surface layer. The collection also includes variance of certain parameters. MERRA-2 is the latest version of global atmospheric reanalysis for the satellite era produced by NASA Global Modeling and Assimilation Office (GMAO) using the Goddard Earth Observing System Model (GEOS) version 5.12.4.
