### About Solar Induced Chlorophyll Fluorescence
Solar Induced Chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF) is a byproduct of plant photosynthesis and is a direct measurement of plant response during respiration. During photosynthesis, among the other light reactions, a photon can be re-emitted and this energy decay is known as chlorophyll fluorescence. SIF is a complement to existing greenness indicators such as the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and can be used to serve as a functional proxy for Gross Primary Productivity (GPP).

### About OCO-3
The Orbiting Carbon Observatory-3 (OCO-3) was deployed to the International Space Station in May, 2019. It is technically a single instrument, almost identical to OCO-2.

The Orbiting Carbon Observatory is the first NASA mission designed to collect space-based measurements of atmospheric carbon dioxide with the precision, resolution, and coverage needed to characterize the processes controlling its buildup in the atmosphere.

OCO-3 incorporates three high-resolution spectrometers that make coincident measurements of reflected sunlight in the near-infrared CO<sub>2</sub> near 1.61 and 2.06 micrometers and in molecular oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) A-Band at 0.76 micrometers. The three spectrometers have different characteristics and are calibrated independently.
