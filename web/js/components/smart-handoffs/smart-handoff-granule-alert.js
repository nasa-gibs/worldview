      Why am I seeing NONE or “0 out of n” granules when there is imagery displayed on the map?

    <p>
      Many layers in Worldview are made available in
      {' '}
      <a href="https://earthdata.nasa.gov/earth-observation-data/near-real-time/near-real-time-versus-standard-products" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Near Real-Time (NRT)</a>
      {' '}
      and then &quot;backfilled&quot; by the corresponding Standard (STD) product when it is available. Worldview displays them on a
      <a href="https://wiki.earthdata.nasa.gov/display/GIBS/GIBS+API+for+Developers#GIBSAPIforDevelopers-%22BestAvailable%22Layers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> &quot;Best Available&quot; </a>
      basis, showing Standard-quality imagery if it is available, NRT otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Often layers will have both NRT and STD collections available for download in Earthdata Search. If you are looking
      for data within the last ~7 days you will likely want to use the NRT collection.  If you have the NRT collection
      selected and the granule count shows &quot;NONE&quot;, this may be an indication that your selected date is too far in the past and you
      may have better luck with the STD collection.
    </p>
    <p>You may also see NONE or “0 out of n” granules when:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        The area of interest does not encompass any of the imagery displayed on the map.
      </li>
      <li>
        The area of interest is encompassing imagery but the collection&apos;s metadata record does not contain the appropriate spatial
        information for this feature to work. Unchecking the &quot;Set Area of Interest&quot; box should address this.
      </li>
    </ol>
