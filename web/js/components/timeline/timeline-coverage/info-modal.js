        Time-varying layers that have matching temporal coverage are shown in the timeline (bottom of screen) as a solid blue line, making it easier to determine when multiple layers have temporally coincident imagery.

            Including layers that are hidden may affect the display of the timelineâ€™s solid blue overlapping coverage line as it will take into account the dates of those layers, too.
