# Contributing

Thanks for considering contributing and making our planet easier to explore!

We'd be quite excited if you'd like to contribute to Worldview! Whether you're finding bugs, adding new features, fixing anything broken, or improving documentation, get started by submitting an issue or pull request!

## Submitting an Issue

If you have any questions or ideas, or notice any problems or bugs, first [search open issues](https://github.com/nasa-gibs/worldview/issues) to see if the issue has already been submitted. We may already be [working on the issue](#what-were-working-on). If you think your issue is new, you're welcome to [create a new issue](https://github.com/nasa-gibs/worldview/issues/new).

## Pull Requests

If you want to submit your own contributions, follow these steps;

* Fork the Worldview repo
* Create a new branch from the branch you'd like to contribute to
* If an issue does't already exist, submit one (see above)
* [Create a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) from your fork into the target branch of the nasa-gibs/worldview repo
* Be sure to [mention the corresponding issue number](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-using-keywords/) in the PR description, i.e. "Fixes [#480](https://github.com/nasa-gibs/worldview/issues/480)"
* Upon submission of a pull request, the Worldview development team will review the code
* The request will then either be merged, declined, or an adjustment to the code will be requested

## Guidelines

## What We're Working On

Please see our [Roadmap](https://github.com/nasa-gibs/worldview/projects/7) for an overview of what we're planning.

We use GitHub labels to organize issues we're working on. Here are the labels we use, along with descriptions of what they mean. Click on the headings or badges below to see the GitHub issues tagged with each label.

### [`bug` ![Issues tagged with 'bug'](https://img.shields.io/github/issues-raw/nasa-gibs/worldview/bug.svg)](https://github.com/nasa-gibs/worldview/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Abug)

Things that appear to be broken or are not working as intended.

### [`enhancement` ![Issues tagged with 'enhancement' ](https://img.shields.io/github/issues-raw/nasa-gibs/worldview/enhancement.svg)](https://github.com/nasa-gibs/worldview/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aenhancement)

An enhancement to an existing feature.

### [`external dependency` ![Issues tagged with 'external dependency'](https://img.shields.io/github/issues-raw/nasa-gibs/worldview/%22external%20dependency%22.svg)](https://github.com/nasa-gibs/worldview/issues?q=is%3Aopen%20is%3Aissue%20label%3A%22external%20dependency%22)

Issues that are waiting on something out of our control.

### [`help wanted` ![Issues tagged with 'help wanted'](https://img.shields.io/github/issues-raw/nasa-gibs/worldview/%22help%20wanted%22.svg)](https://github.com/nasa-gibs/worldview/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help%20wanted%22)

These issues might be a good place to start if you want to contribute.

### [`idea` ![Issues tagged with 'idea'](https://img.shields.io/github/issues-raw/nasa-gibs/worldview/idea.svg)](https://github.com/nasa-gibs/worldview/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aidea)

These are ideas, user stories, or feature requests that don't yet qualify as a new feature, probably because the specifics haven't been worked out yet.

### [`new feature` ![Issues tagged with 'new feature'](https://img.shields.io/github/issues-raw/nasa-gibs/worldview/%22new%20feature%22.svg)](https://github.com/nasa-gibs/worldview/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22new%20feature%22)

These are new features to be developed at some point in the future.

### [`ready for development` ![Issues tagged with 'ready for development'](https://img.shields.io/github/issues-raw/nasa-gibs/worldview/%22ready%20for%20development%22.svg)](https://github.com/nasa-gibs/worldview/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22ready%20for%20development%22)

These are issues that are "on deck" for development. We're planning to work on these next.

### [`testing` ![Issues tagged with 'testing'](https://img.shields.io/github/issues-raw/nasa-gibs/worldview/testing.svg)](https://github.com/nasa-gibs/worldview/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Atesting)

These are issues that have a PR ready to resolve them, and are just waiting to be fully tested.

### [`technical` ![Issues tagged with 'technical'](https://img.shields.io/github/issues-raw/nasa-gibs/worldview/technical.svg)](https://github.com/nasa-gibs/worldview/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Atechnical)

These issues are related to our technical implementation (refactoring, dependency changes, etc), they're developer focused, and don't directly add new features for end users.

### [`under development` ![Issues tagged with 'under development'](https://img.shields.io/github/issues-raw/nasa-gibs/worldview/%22under%20development%22.svg)](https://github.com/nasa-gibs/worldview/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22under%20development%22)

These are ideas, user stories, or feature requests that don't yet qualify as a new feature, probably because the specifics haven't been worked out yet.

### [`wontfix` ![Issues tagged with 'wontfix'](https://img.shields.io/github/issues-raw/nasa-gibs/worldview/wontfix.svg)](https://github.com/nasa-gibs/worldview/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Awontfix)

These are issues that we don't plan to fix.
