# Contributing

Thanks for considering contributing and making our planet easier to explore!

We'd be quite excited if you'd like to contribute to Worldview! Whether you're finding bugs, adding new features, fixing anything broken, or improving documentation, get started by submitting an issue or pull request!

## Submitting an Issue

If you have any questions or ideas, or notice any problems or bugs, first [search open issues](https://github.com/nasa-gibs/worldview/issues) to see if the issue has already been submitted. We may already be [working on the issue](#what-were-working-on). If you think your issue is new, you're welcome to [create a new issue](https://github.com/nasa-gibs/worldview/issues/new).

## Pull Requests

If you want to submit your own contributions, follow these steps;

* Fork the Worldview repo
* Create a new branch from the branch you'd like to contribute to
* If an issue does't already exist, submit one (see above)
* [Create a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) from your fork into the target branch of the nasa-gibs/worldview repo
* Be sure to [mention the corresponding issue number](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-using-keywords/) in the PR description, i.e. "Fixes [#480](https://github.com/nasa-gibs/worldview/issues/480)"
* Upon submission of a pull request, the Worldview development team will review the code
* The request will then either be merged, declined, or an adjustment to the code will be requested

## Guidelines

We ask that you follow these guidelines with your contributions;

### Tests

Issues that are waiting on something out of our control.

### `help wanted`

[![Issues tagged with 'help wanted'](https://img.shields.io/github/issues-raw/nasa-gibs/worldview/help%20wanted.svg)](https://github.com/nasa-gibs/worldview/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Ahelp%20wanted)

These issues might be a good place to start if you want to contribute.

These are ideas, user stories, or feature requests that don't yet qualify as a new feature, probably because the specifics haven't been worked out yet.

### `new feature`

[![Issues tagged with 'new feature'](https://img.shields.io/github/issues-raw/nasa-gibs/worldview/new%20feature.svg)](https://github.com/nasa-gibs/worldview/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Anew%20feature)

These are new features to be developed at some point in the future.

### `ready for development`

[![Issues tagged with 'ready for development'](https://img.shields.io/github/issues-raw/nasa-gibs/worldview/ready%20for%20development.svg)](https://github.com/nasa-gibs/worldview/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aready%20for%20development)

These are issues that are "on deck" for development. We're planning to work on these next.

### `ready for test`

[![Issues tagged with 'ready for test'](https://img.shields.io/github/issues-raw/nasa-gibs/worldview/ready%20for%20test.svg)](https://github.com/nasa-gibs/worldview/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aready%20for%20test)

These are issues that have a PR ready to resolve them, and are just waiting to be fully tested.

### `technical`

[![Issues tagged with 'technical'](https://img.shields.io/github/issues-raw/nasa-gibs/worldview/technical.svg)](https://github.com/nasa-gibs/worldview/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Atechnical)

These issues are related to our technical implementation (refactoring, dependency changes, etc), they're developer focused, and don't directly add new features for end users.

### `under development`

[![Issues tagged with 'under development'](https://img.shields.io/github/issues-raw/nasa-gibs/worldview/under%20development.svg)](https://github.com/nasa-gibs/worldview/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aunder%20development)
